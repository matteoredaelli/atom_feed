      <title>New Study on Air Traffic Control Reform</title>
      <link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chris Edwards&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;img

      style="float: right; margin-left: 8px; margin-right: 8px;"
      width="350" height="467"&gt;Robert Poole is one the nation’s
      top experts on privatization and transportation policy
      reform. He has a &lt;a
      href="http://ifi.hudson.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=publication_details&amp;amp;id=9826&amp;amp;pubType=IFI_Studies_Papers"&gt;great
      new Hudson Institute study&lt;/a&gt; on problems with our air
      traffic control (ATC) system and ideas for restructuring it.
      The nation’s ATC system is operated by the Federal Aviation
      Administration (FAA). Here are some of Bob’s
      findings:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;The features and
      procedures of our government-run ATC system “have remained
      remarkably unchanged through a half century of dramatic
      advances in technology” elsewhere in the economy.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Our ATC system “has fallen well behind the capacity
      of new technologies to provide &amp;nbsp;safer, faster, more
      reliable, and more fuel efficient air travel and to keep up
      with the increasing volume of air travel.”&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;“Nearly all communications are still by voice
      radio, despite the ubiquity of text messaging and its greater
      ease and accuracy for routine communications.”&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;“Radar remains the principal means of aircraft
      position surveillance, despite the much greater accuracy of
      GPS and other systems.”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The FAA “is slow
      to embrace promising innovations in outside research
      organizations or private-sector companies.”&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The FAA “does a poor job of procuring new
      technology, with many programs eventually cancelled or
      emerging years late at inflated cost.”&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The FAA “is particularly resistant to
      high-potential innovations that would disrupt its own
      institutional status quo.”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Canada,
      Australia, New Zealand, Britain, and Germany are doing a
      better job of embracing new technologies for ATC. These
      countries have restructured their systems as self-supporting
      organizations outside of their government
      bureaucracies.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ultimately,
      the culprit for America falling behind on ATC is not the FAA,
      but Congress. Congress has its head buried in the sand.
      Aviation demand is rising and our government-run system is
      not up to the challenge. ATC is an increasingly dynamic,
      high-tech business, and it is too important to consign to the
      lethargy, inefficiency, and bungling that dominates so many
      Washington bureaucracies.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; For
      more, &lt;a
      href="http://www.downsizinggovernment.org/transportation/airports-atc"&gt;see
      this study&lt;/a&gt; on airport and ATC reform, and &lt;a

      <title>In Maryland, A Left-Right Alliance on
      Surveillance</title>
      <link>
      http://feeds.cato.org/~r/Cato-at-liberty/~3/ADXK2mXBqIM/maryland-left-right-alliance-surveillance</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Walter Olson&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some
      issues lend themselves well to cooperation between liberals
      and conservatives who can both see the need to limit the
      arbitrary power of government. One prime prospect: the
      dangers to individual privacy of government surveillance run
      amok. This week in Annapolis several members of the Maryland
      legislature held a press conference to announce that they
      would push for an agenda of reforms setting out rules for law
      enforcement&amp;#8217;s use of techniques including phone
      location tracking, automatic license plate readers, email
      surveillance,&amp;nbsp;and drones. The group is led by Sen.
      Jamie Raskin (D-Silver Spring), one of the strongest liberals
      in the state legislature, and Sen. Chris Shank
      (R-Hagerstown), one of the strongest conservatives. Here
      (quoting verbatim) is the summary provided by the &lt;a
      href="http://www.aclu-md.org/press_room/158"&gt;ACLU of
      Maryland&lt;/a&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Email surveillance&lt;/strong&gt;.
      Legislation to require that law enforcement go before a
      neutral arbiter and prove that the information they are
      obtaining is likely to turn up evidence of a crime before
      intercepting and accessing online data.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location Tracking&lt;/strong&gt;.
      Legislation to require that law enforcement get a warrant
      based on probable cause prior to obtaining mobile phone
      tracking information.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drones.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Legislation
      to impose limits and regulations on aerial surveillance that
      would protect against police fishing expeditions, and abusive
      use of these tools.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automatic License Plate
      Recorders&lt;/strong&gt;. Legislation that would keep law
      enforcement from storing records of license plates and
      locations that are not ‘hits’ against any
      database.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span
      style="line-height: 1.3em;"&gt;Others sponsoring the bills
      include Democratic delegates from Baltimore City and
      Montgomery County as well as Del. Mike Smigiel (R-Eastern
      Shore), a prominent supporter of Second Amendment
      rights.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Looks like
      something worth keeping an eye on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div

      <title>Obama Allows Congress to Participate in
      Lawmaking</title>
      <link>
      http://feeds.cato.org/~r/Cato-at-liberty/~3/m8DQcGYzzK8/obama-allows-congress-participate-lawmaking</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;David Boaz&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This
      headline appeared in Thursday&amp;#8217;s
      &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;img
      src="http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/wp-content/uploads/obama_give_congress.jpg"
      alt="Obama allows Congress a voice in NSA" width="707"
      height="533"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story &lt;a
      href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-expected-to-turn-to-congress-to-help-decide-fate-of-nsa-phone-data-collection/2014/01/15/cddc83fa-7e0a-11e3-95c6-0a7aa80874bc_story.html"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;
      that President Obama “will call on Congress to help determine
      the [NSA surveillance] program’s future. Which is good
      because Article I, Section 1, of the Constitution of the
      United States provides that:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All legislative Powers herein
      granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United
      States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Deciding the
      scope and extent of any federal surveillance powers is
      clearly a legislative matter. Subject to the constraints
      imposed by the Constitution&amp;#8217;s limits on federal
      powers, legislative powers are vested in Congress, not the
      president. How can reporters (and headline writers) write so
      cavalierly about the president “giving” Congress a chance to
      “weigh in” on matters of fundamental law? This headline
      should be as jarring as one reading, “Obama plans to give
      Supreme Court a say in fate of NSA program.” It
      isn&amp;#8217;t up to the president. The legislative branch
      is empowered by the Constitution to make law, and the
      judicial branch is empowered to strike down legislative and
      executive actions not authorized by the Constitution. The
      president&amp;#8217;s job is to “take Care that the Laws be
      faithfully executed.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Arthur Schlesinger
      Jr. &lt;a

      &amp;quot;Chip&amp;quot; Knappenberger&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;a
      href="http://www.cato.org/blog/tags/global-science-report"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Global
      Science Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a feature
      from the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a
      href="http://www.cato.org/projects.php#css"
      target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Center for the Study of
      Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, where we highlight
      one or two important new items in the scientific literature
      or the popular media. For broader and more technical
      perspectives, consult our monthly “Current
      Wisdom.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last summer, we
      predicted that come this winter, any type of severe weather
      event was going to be linked to pernicious industrial
      activity (via global warming) through a new mechanism that
      had become a media darling—the loss of late summer/early fall
      Arctic sea ice leading to more persistent patterns in the jet
      stream. These are known as “blocking” patterns, which
      generally means that the same type of weather (usually
      somewhat extremish) hangs around longer than usual.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This
      global-warming-leading-to-more-extreme-winter-weather
      mechanism has been presented in several recent papers,
      perhaps the most noteworthy of which was a 2012 publication
      by Jennifer Francis and Stephen Vavrus, which was the subject
      of one of our &lt;a
      href="http://www.cato.org/blog/tenuous-link-between-stronger-winter-storms-global-warming-becomes-even-weaker"&gt;blog
      posts&lt;/a&gt; last summer. We noted then how their idea ran
      counter to much of the extant literature of the topic as well
      as a host of other newly published papers investigating
      historical jet stream patterns.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After
      running through a list of observations compiled from the
      scientific literature countering the Francis and Vavrus
      explanation of things, we nevertheless wondered:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’ll be interesting to see during
      this upcoming winter season how often the press—which seems
      intent on seeking to relate all bad weather events to
      anthropogenic global warming—turns to the Francis and Vavrus
      explanation of winter weather events, and whether or not the
      growing body of new and conflicting science is ever brought
      up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;We didn’t have to
      wait long. After a couple of early winter southward Arctic
      air excursions, the familiar and benign-sounding “jet stream”
      had become the “polar vortex”&lt;a title=""
      href="#_ftn1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; which “&lt;a
      href="http://pjmedia.com/eddriscoll/2014/01/07/polar-vortex/"&gt;sucked
      in&lt;/a&gt;” the United States. Of course, the U.S. being
      sucked into a polar vortex was part and parcel of what was
      &lt;a
      href="http://science.time.com/2014/01/06/climate-change-driving-cold-weather/"&gt;to
      be expected&lt;/a&gt; from global warming.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Since we had predicted this action/reaction, we
      weren’t terribly surprised.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What did
      surprise us (although perhaps it shouldn’t have) is that the
      White House joined in the polar vortex horror show and
      released a video in which John Holdren, the&#160; President’s
      Science Advisor—arguably the highest ranking “scientist” in
      the U.S.—linked the frigid air to global warming:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div class="oembed oembed-video"&gt; &lt;a
      href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDTzV6a9F4"
      class="oembed-title"&gt;The Polar Vortex Explained in 2
      Minutes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;div class="oembed-content
      responsivevideo-wrapper" style="padding-top: 56.25%"&gt;
      &lt;iframe
      src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/5eDTzV6a9F4?feature=oembed&amp;amp;wmode=transparent"
      frameborder="0" allowfullscreen
      wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the video, Holdren boldly
      stated:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;…a growing
      body of evidence suggests that kind of extreme cold being
      experienced by much of the United States as we speak is a
      pattern that we can expect to see with increasing frequency
      as global warming continues…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It seems that Holdren neither keeps up with our
      writings at Cato nor the scientific literature on the
      topic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While perhaps it could be argued
      that Holdren’s statement is not an outright lie, it is, at
      its very best, a half-truth and even a stretch at that. For
      in fact, there is a &lt;em&gt;larger&lt;/em&gt; and
      &lt;em&gt;faster&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;growing&lt;/em&gt; body
      of evidence that directly &lt;em&gt;disputes&lt;/em&gt;
      Holdren’s contention.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to the
      evidence that we reported on &lt;a
      href="http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/current-wisdom-is-arctic-warming-making-us-miserable"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
      and &lt;a
      href="http://www.cato.org/blog/tenuous-link-between-stronger-winter-storms-global-warming-becomes-even-weaker"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;,
      a couple of brand new papers just hit the scientific journals
      this month that emphatically reject the hypothesis that
      global warming is leading to more blocking patterns in the
      jet stream (and accompanying severe weather outbreaks across
      the U.S.).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first paper is a modeling
      paper by a team of U.K. scientists led by Giacomo Masato from
      the University of Reading. Masato and his colleagues looked
      at how the magnitude and frequency of atmospheric blocking
      events in the Atlantic-Europe region is projected to change
      in the future according to four climate models which the
      authors claim match the observed characteristics of blocking
      events in this region pretty well. What they found was
      completely contradictory to Holdren’s claim. While the
      researchers did note a model-projected small future increase
      in the frequency of blocking patterns over the Atlantic (the
      ones which impact the weather in the U.S.), they found that
      the both the strength of the blocking events as well as the
      associated surface temperature anomalies over the continental
      U.S. were considerably moderated. In other words, global
      warming was expected to make “polar vortex” associated cold
      outbreaks less cold.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The second paper is
      by a research team led by Colorado State University’s
      Elizabeth Barnes. In their paper “Exploring recent trends in
      Northern Hemisphere blocking,” Barnes and colleagues used
      various meteorological definitions of “blocking” along with
      various datasets of atmospheric conditions to assess whether
      or not there have been any trends in the frequency of
      blocking events that could be tied to changes in global
      warming and/or the declines in Arctic sea ice.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;They found no such associations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;From their conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[T]he link between recent Arctic
      warming and increased Northern Hemisphere blocking is
      currently not supported by observations. While Arctic sea ice
      experienced unprecedented losses in recent years, blocking
      frequencies in these years do not appear exceptional, falling
      well within their historically observed range. The large
      variability of blocking occurrence, on both inter-annual and
      decadal time scales, underscores the difficulty in separating
      any potentially forced response from natural
      variability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;In other
      words natural variability dominates the observed record
      making it impossible to detect any human-caused global
      warming signal even if one were to exist (which there is no
      proof of).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, the most recent science
      shows 1) no observed relationship between global warming and
      winter severe weather outbreaks and 2) future “polar
      vortex”-associated cold outbreaks are projected to
      mollify—yet the White House prepares a special video
      proclaiming the opposite with the intent to spread climate
      alarm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Full scientific disclosure in
      matters pertaining to global warming is not a characteristic
      that we have come to expect with this
      Administration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How's That Oversight Coming Along?</title>
      <link>
      http://feeds.cato.org/~r/Cato-at-liberty/~3/i4KRDFOzoBc/hows-oversight-coming-along</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jim Harper&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of
      the claims made by defenders of NSA spying is that
      it&amp;#8217;s overseen and approved by all three branches of
      the federal government.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Computer security
      expert Bruce Schneier provides some insight into how well
      congressional oversight is working in a short blog post
      entitled: “&lt;a
      href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/01/today_i_briefed.html"&gt;Today
      I Briefed Congress on the NSA&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This morning I spent an hour in a
      closed room with six Members of Congress: Rep. Logfren, Rep.
      Sensenbrenner, Rep. Scott, Rep. Goodlate, Rep Thompson, and
      Rep. Amash. No staffers, no public: just them. Lofgren asked
      me to brief her and a few Representatives on the NSA. She
      said that the NSA wasn&amp;#8217;t forthcoming about their
      activities, and they wanted me &amp;#8211; as someone with
      access to the Snowden documents &amp;#8211; to explain to
      them what the NSA was doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Many members of Congress have been derelict for
      years in not overseeing the National Security Agency. Now
      some members of Congress are asking questions, and
      they&amp;#8217;re being stonewalled.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s the government
      so&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I
      suggested that we hold this meeting in a &lt;a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitive_Compartmented_Information_Facility"&gt;SCIF&lt;/a&gt;,
      because they wanted me to talk about top secret documents
      that had not been made public. The problem is that I, as
      someone without a clearance, would not be allowed into the
      SCIF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Randy Barnett and
      I &lt;a
      href="http://www.cato.org/publications/legal-briefs/re-electronic-privacy-information-center"&gt;made
      the case last fall&lt;/a&gt; that the panels of judges who
      approve domestic spying under the Foreign Intelligence
      Surveillance Act should not be regarded as legitimate courts.
      Their use to dispose of Americans’ rights violates due
      process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And the executive branch? &lt;a
      href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130906/12240724433/president-obama-says-he-learns-what-nsa-is-doing-press-then-goes-to-nsa-details.shtml"&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt;
      President Obama: “I mean, part of the problem here is we get
      these through the press and then I&amp;#8217;ve got to go
      back and find out what’s going on&amp;#8230;”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;How&amp;#8217;s that tri-partite oversight coming
      along?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt; &lt;a

      <title>Fordham's Confusion Over Means and Ends</title>
      <link>
      http://feeds.cato.org/~r/Cato-at-liberty/~3/3aiX8Kn4688/fordhams-confusion-over-means-ends</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jason Bedrick&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On
      Tuesday, the Fordham Institute released a “&lt;a
      href="http://www.edexcellence.net/publications/public-accountability-private-school-choice"&gt;toolkit&lt;/a&gt;”
      proposing that all private schools accepting students
      participating in school choice programs be required to
      administer the state test. Low-performing schools would be
      forbidden to participate in the school choice program. As I
      explained then, that would&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;de
      facto&lt;/em&gt; entail &lt;a
      href="http://www.cato.org/blog/common-coring-private-schools"&gt;forcing
      almost all private schools into the Common Core
      regime&lt;/a&gt;, thereby stifling innovation and diversity.
      The &lt;a
      href="http://www.edchoice.org/Blog/January-2013/Are-Private-Schools-Accountable-"&gt;Friedman
      Foundation&lt;/a&gt; pointed to a recent study showing how
      parents hold private schools accountable already. &lt;a
      href="http://jaypgreene.com/2014/01/14/fordham-vs-fordham-on-private-choice-transparency/"&gt;Matt
      Ladner&lt;/a&gt; highlighted Fordham&amp;#8217;s own previous
      research that exposed state accountability measures as
      fradulant “illusions.” &lt;a
      href="http://jaypgreene.com/2014/01/14/fordham-vs-fordham-on-private-choice-transparency/"&gt;Greg
      Forster&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;cast a gimlet eye on
      Fordham&amp;#8217;s assurance that existing private schools
      don&amp;#8217;t really mind the state tests:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, Fordham is operating
      out of a top-down, anti-entrepreneurial mindset. Existing
      private schools are not the voice of entrepreneurial
      innovation. They are the rump left behind by the crowding out
      of a real private school marketplace; they are niche
      providers who have found a way to make a cozy go of it in the
      nooks and crannies left behind by the state monopoly. They
      are protecting their turf against innovators just as much as
      the state monopoly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Milton once used the
      analogy of hot dog vendors. If you put a “free” government
      hot dog vendor on every street corner, the real hot dog
      vendors will all vanish. The same has happened to private
      schools. If we extend the analogy, we could say that a few
      hot dog vendors might survive by catering to niche markets –
      maybe the government hot dog stands can’t sell kosher hot
      dogs because that would be entanglement with religion. But
      the niche vendors would not be representative of all that is
      possible in the field of hot dog vending.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And the private schools that don’t participate in
      choice programs are probably the least entrepreneurial.
      Notice, for example, that their top complaint is that choice
      isn’t universal. Why would that prevent them from
      participating in choice programs? Wouldn’t they want to reach
      out and serve the kids they can serve, even as they advocate
      for expansion of the programs to serve others? The private
      schools participating in choice programs are doing so; they
      may not be paragons of entrepreneurship, but they are at
      least entrepreneurial enough to want to help as many kids as
      they can. The demand for bigger choice payments is also not a
      sign of hungry innovation on their part (even if the choice
      payments are paltry in may
      places).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;In response,
      Fordham&amp;#8217;s new president, Michael Petrilli,
      acknowledges (some of) these concerns, but &lt;a
      href="http://www.edexcellence.net/commentary/education-gadfly-daily/flypaper/the-problem-with-“bad-voucher-schools-aren’t-a-problem”"&gt;oddly
      claims&lt;/a&gt; that since we don&amp;#8217;t share his
      proposed government solution, we also must not share his
      concern about poorly performing private schools.
      It&amp;#8217;s as though Petrilli proposes dousing a burning
      building with gasoline but when others object that this is a
      bad idea, he accuses them of thinking that the burning
      building is a not really a problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sure,
      as Petrilli notes, there are poorly performing private
      schools just as there are poorly performing government
      schools. The question is which system is more likely to
      reduce the number of bad schools and increase the number of
      good ones: a system of uniform accountability to the
      government or a diverse and innovative system where
      accountability is directly to parents? We believe that &lt;a
      href="http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/articles/10.1.1.175.6495.pdf"&gt;the
      evidence&lt;/a&gt; supports the latter and &lt;a
      href="http://www.cato.org/blog/common-coring-private-schools"&gt;demonstrated&lt;/a&gt;
      why the evidence Fordham relies on lies somewhere between
      flimsy and non-existent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Petrilli has at
      least shown a potential willingness to back down from the
      worst elements of his proposal:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe the tests that voucher
      students take need not be the state tests so long as they’re
      solid measures of achievement. Perhaps we need to let schools
      point to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
      href="http://www.edexcellence.net/commentary/education-gadfly-daily/flypaper/2013/why-the-opt-out-is-not-a-cop-out.html"&gt;alternative
      measures of student outcomes&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;before they
      are kicked out of choice programs. Possibly we need an
      accountability regime that’s completely separate from that
      which governs the public schools. Such compromises might help
      to ensure that the educational diversity of the private
      school marketplace isn’t inadvertently
      diminished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, he still clings to the notion that
      what we have now is somehow a “market” in education,
      concluding: “But the answer cannot be ‘let the market figure
      it out.’ Because it hasn’t, and it won’t—and somebody must.”
      But as Forster noted, a system where 90 percent of the
      “market” is consumed by the “free” government schools is not
      really a market. If we really want more accountability, then
      we need more choices. Even Petrilli admits that sometimes
      families choose a poorly performing private school because
      it&amp;#8217;s the only alternative to a worse performing (or
      unsafe) government school. Eliminating that alternative by
      forbidding the private school from participating in a school
      choice program won&amp;#8217;t do any good for those
      low-income families who will then be shuffled back to the
      government school.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span
      style="line-height: 1.3em;"&gt;Instead of government-induced
      conformity, let&amp;#8217;s push for broader education choice
      programs that give the private schools the space to
      innovate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:
      1.3em;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div

      <title>What the DEA and Drug Traffickers Have in
      Common</title>
      <link>
      http://feeds.cato.org/~r/Cato-at-liberty/~3/S4oqrn0ovBk/what-dea-drug-traffickers-have-common</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey A. Miron&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In
      today&amp;#8217;s &lt;a
      href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/dea-operations-chief-decries-legalization-of-marijuana-at-state-level/2014/01/15/17af548a-7e38-11e3-9556-4a4bf7bcbd84_story.html"&gt;WaPo&lt;/a&gt;,
      the DEA&amp;#8217;s Chief of Operations James L. Capra claims
      that:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span
      style="line-height: 1.3em;"&gt;the movement to decriminalize
      the sale of pot in the United States will have severe
      consequences. &amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp;Every part of the world
      where this has been tried, it has failed time and time
      again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:
      1.3em;"&gt;Capra&amp;#8217;s assertion is so ignorant of the
      facts that it merits little comment; instead, read Glenn
      Greenwald&amp;#8217;s &lt;a
      href="http://www.cato.org/publications/white-paper/drug-decriminalization-portugal-lessons-creating-fair-successful-drug-policies"&gt;Cato
      study&lt;/a&gt; on decriminalization in Portugal, which shows
      just the opposite of Capra&amp;#8217;s
      claim.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span
      style="line-height: 1.3em;"&gt;Capra&amp;#8217;s statement
      about “severe consequences” is not entirely wrong, however;
      legalization will put thousands of DEA and other law
      enforcement officials out of work! Perhaps, therefore, the
      government should outlaw food, clothing, and shelter; then we
      could emply billions in the attempt to enforce those
      laws.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An interesting side
      note is that, like law enforcement officials, drug
      traffickers also fear legalization. See minute 4:00 of &lt;a
      href="http://www.vocativ.com/video/colombian-cocaine-factory/"&gt;this

      <title>Egypt’s Shambolic Constitutional Process</title>
      <link>
      http://feeds.cato.org/~r/Cato-at-liberty/~3/b1gpAuNZeXI/egypts-shambolic-constitutional-process</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dalibor Rohac&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.3em;"&gt;Don’t let
      yourself be fooled by the overwhelming approval of the new
      Egyptian constitution in the referendum held earlier this
      week. While, according to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
      style="line-height: 1.3em;"
      href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/91686.aspx"&gt;preliminary
      results&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.3em;"&gt;,
      the vast majority of roughly 37 percent of Egyptians who
      showed up at the polls &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style="line-height:
      1.3em;"
      href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/01/16/uk-egypt-referendum-idUKBREA0E1EE20140116"&gt;backed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span
      style="line-height: 1.3em;"&gt; the proposal, very little
      about the document itself or about the process through which
      it has come about is consistent with the idea of liberal
      democracy and limited government. Yesterday’s
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style="line-height: 1.3em;"
      href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-15/egypt-will-regret-its-new-constitution.html"&gt;Bloomberg
      View editorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:
      1.3em;"&gt; summarizes all one needs to know about the new
      constitution:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:
      1.3em;"&gt;The armed forces would for at least the next eight
      years be independent of civilian control, including over
      their budget, as they were under former President Hosni
      Mubarak, himself an air force commander. Military courts
      would remain autonomous and would have jurisdiction over
      civilians in many instances. The hated police would also get
      greater independence, while the Supreme Court would be able
      to decide its size and membership for
      itself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.3em;"&gt;Neither
      should there be any illusions about the events leading to the
      adoption of the document. The referendum followed months of a
      deliberate crackdown on the opposition and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
      style="line-height: 1.3em;"
      href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/egypt/10329543/Egypt-court-disbands-Muslim-Brotherhood.html"&gt;disbanding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span
      style="line-height: 1.3em;"&gt; of the largest political
      force in the country – not to speak of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
      style="line-height: 1.3em;"
      href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/01/13/egypt-activists-arrested-no-campaign"&gt;arrests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span
      style="line-height: 1.3em;"&gt; of activists of the ‘no’
      campaign.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span
      style="line-height: 1.3em;"&gt;In short, Egypt seems to be
      coming full circle to where it was before the events of the
      Arab Spring, particularly if General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style="line-height: 1.3em;"
      href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/06/us-egypt-sisi-idUSBREA050VP20140106"&gt;announces&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span
      style="line-height: 1.3em;"&gt; his candidature for the
      country’s highest office. The question is how long the
      Egyptians are willing to put up with
      it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span
      style="line-height: 1.3em;"&gt;As a side note, the
      constitutional process in Tunisia looks &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a

      href="http://www.npr.org/2014/01/12/261843760/new-constitution-is-a-sign-of-tunisias-optimism"&gt;much
      more encouraging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:

      <title>What to Look for in the Upcoming Trade Policy
      Debate</title>
      <link>
      http://feeds.cato.org/~r/Cato-at-liberty/~3/D8cP1Hc5Rpg/what-look-upcoming-trade-policy-debate</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;K. William Watson&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The most important piece of trade legislation
      Congress has dealt with in years was introduced in the House
      and Senate last week. The “Bipartisan Congressional Trade
      Priorities Act of 2014” sets out the parameters for renewing
      trade promotion authority (TPA), originally known as “fast
      track,” in order to ease eventual passage of the
      Trans-Pacific Partnership and other agreements through
      Congress. There will be a lot of debate in the coming months
      about what U.S. trade policy should look like, and this TPA
      bill will do a lot to establish the agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a
      href="http://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/TPA%20bill%20text.pdf"&gt;new
      bill&lt;/a&gt; largely mirrors the last TPA grant in
      2002.&amp;nbsp; The basic idea of fast track is that Congress
      agrees to hold an up-or-down vote on any trade agreement
      submitted by the president, while the president agrees to
      adopt a series of negotiating objectives laid out by
      Congress.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve explained before
      why I think TPA is &lt;a
      href="http://www.cato.org/publications/free-trade-bulletin/stay-fast-track-why-trade-promotion-authority-wrong-trans-pacific"&gt;not
      necessary right now&lt;/a&gt; to get agreements through
      Congress and why it could even &lt;a
      href="http://www.cato.org/multimedia/daily-podcast/fast-track-authoritys-dubious-record"&gt;make
      the TPP negotiations more difficult&lt;/a&gt;. However, that
      argument is temporarily moot since this TPA bill is on the
      table and will apply not only to the TPP but to the U.S.-EU
      trade agreement and any World Trade Organzation negotiations
      for the next four years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Defeat
      of this bill could quite possibly &lt;a
      href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304617404579306221047716030"&gt;kill
      any chance the president has&lt;/a&gt; to conclude trade
      agreements before the end of his term. Also, the negotiating
      objectives included in the new bill are not as bad as I had
      feared.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At this point, we should be
      talking about what’s in the new TPA bill and how it might
      change as the debate heats up.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;p&gt; For starters, the bill’s weak
      language on currency manipulation is particularly
      encouraging. American automakers and their allies among House
      Democrats have made &lt;a
      href="http://www.cato.org/publications/free-trade-bulletin/appreciate-chinese-currency-rise-will-have-negligible-effect-trade-deficit"&gt;“misaligned”
      foreign currency&lt;/a&gt; their number one trade issue and
      have insisted on very strong language in TPA. The
      administration, however, has stated that it does not want the
      issue addressed in the TPP agreement, as other countries in
      the negotiations are &lt;a
      href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economy/leave-currency-manipulation-out-of-trade-talks-ed-fast-urges/article14563787/"&gt;strongly
      opposed&lt;/a&gt; to the inclusion of currency
      rules.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The current text of the
      TPA bill calls out currency manipulation as a problem but
      leaves the president a lot of discretion. The political cost
      of that discretion has been a complete lack of support from
      House Democrats. Dan Ikenson &lt;a
      href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/danikenson/2014/01/13/fast-track-bill-presented-but-progress-on-trade-requires-the-president-stand-up-to-detroit/"&gt;has
      explained the troubling politics of this situation&lt;/a&gt;
      and calls for the president to take a tougher stance against
      Detroit if he wants to make progress with his own trade
      agenda.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On labor and the environment, the
      new TPA bill maintains the status quo in U.S. trade policy.
      The language requiring our trade partners to abide by
      specific international labor and environmental agreements was
      not included in the 2002 TPA but reflects a compromise
      reached in 2007, when Democrats took control of the House.
      Despite the fact that Republicans have regained their
      majority, many were worried that the new TPA would impose
      even stronger objectives on labor and environmental
      requirements.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If support from
      House Democrats is already lost because of the currency
      issue, Republicans may want to consider whether there’s any
      room to roll back the objectives on labor and environment.
      Free trade should not be contingent on the adoption of
      foreign labor and environmental standards. As Dan Griswold
      &lt;a
      href="http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/protectionism-green-face-union-bug"&gt;succinctly
      explained&lt;/a&gt; when Congress was debating another fast
      track bill fifteen years ago:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This debate is not about worker
      rights or a cleaner environment. It’s about the freedom of
      people in America and abroad to engage in mutually beneficial
      trade. In the real world, the international standards and
      trade sanctions that opponents of fast-track insist upon
      could in fact slow progress toward better living standards in
      poor countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now
      fast track imposes those very same standards and sanctions,
      but opponents are still not satisfied. Perhaps this Congress
      in 2014 is incapable of imbuing the trade agenda with
      much-needed faith in the free market, but there’s little to
      lose from trying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new TPA bill also
      continues the past policy of promoting strong intellectual
      property rules through trade agreements. This is an area
      where the United States has to &lt;a
      href="http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/free-trades-sake-get-ip-out-tpp"&gt;expend
      a considerable amount of negotiating capital&lt;/a&gt; to get
      marginal changes in foreign IP laws that benefit a handful of
      U.S. industries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IP has also
      become a focus of domestic opposition to the U.S. trade
      agenda, as copyright and patent reform advocates recognize
      the dangers of locking-in bad policy through international
      agreements. Like labor and environmental targets, the IP
      component of the trade agenda is an issue where congressional
      consensus exists despite a pressing need for serious
      debate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, some separate trade
      initiatives may get tied-in to the passage of TPA.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Democrats are certain to insist on an extension of
      the &lt;a
      href="http://www.cato.org/publications/trade-briefing-paper/maladjusted-misguided-policy-trade-adjustment-assistance"&gt;Trade
      Adjustment Assistance&lt;/a&gt; program before supporting
      TPA. Trade Adjustment Assistance provides greater welfare
      benefits to people who can tie their job loss to import
      competition. It is an entitlement program whose primary
      purpose is to demonize trade while assuaging anti-trade
      constituencies. In truth, these jobs are lost due to economic
      growth and trade is only one of many ways to ensure a dynamic
      and competitive economy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, the
      Generalized System of Preferences program that grants
      tariff-free treatment to imports from poor countries could be
      extended in conjunction with passage of TPA. The program,
      though it has its faults, helps many consumers and producers
      in the United States and creates economic opportunity for
      people who desperately need it. Despite being generally
      popular in Congress, the program &lt;a
      href="http://www.cato.org/blog/how-did-us-trade-policy-progress-2013"&gt;expired
      last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;TPA offers Congress
      an opportunity both to support and to shape the U.S. trade
      agenda. Perhaps the current set of negotiating objectives is
      the best that can be done with this particular Congress this
      year.&amp;nbsp; But, this is a good time to have a debate
      about the goals of U.S. trade policy: to consider ways to
      make it better and, especially, to keep it from getting
      worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt; &lt;a

      <title>Does Banning Walmart Help Mom-and-Pop
      Retailers?</title>
      <link>
      http://feeds.cato.org/~r/Cato-at-liberty/~3/XyxyH-qfCgQ/does-banning-walmart-help-mom-pops</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey A. Miron&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As
      “Big-Box” retailers like Walmart have proflierated in recent
      years, “Mom-and-Pop” retailers have asked local governments
      to ban or limit Big Boxes, arguing that Walmart and their ilk
      drive small, independent retailers out of business.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;One response to this complaint is, “Too bad.”
      &amp;nbsp;Walmart&amp;#8217;s large size allows it to operate
      efficiently and offer low prices; independents are less
      efficient and so &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; get driven out
      of business. &amp;nbsp;Independents may be better than Big
      Boxes at service, convenience, specialty items, and
      “personality,” so many will survive despite nearby Big Boxes.
      &amp;nbsp;But if some fail and exit, that is what economic
      efficiency demands.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A different response
      is that, even if Big Box entry hurts independents, laws that
      limit Big Boxes do not necessarily help independents.
      &amp;nbsp;That is precisely the conclusion of &lt;a
      href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w19797"&gt;new
      research&lt;/a&gt; by Raffaella Sadun (Harvard Business
      School). &amp;nbsp;Analyzing entry regulation in the United
      Kingdom, she finds that&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;independent retailers were
      actually harmed by the creation of entry barriers against
      large stores. Instead of simply reducing the number of new
      large stores entering a market, the entry barriers created
      the incentive for large retail chains to invest in smaller
      and more centrally located formats, which competed more
      directly with independents and accelerated their
      decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus even if
      policymakers want to protect small retailers, the “treatment”
      (government intervention) can be worse than the “disease”
      (competition)!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt; &lt;a

      <title>Minimum Wage and Unemployment</title>
      <link>
      http://feeds.cato.org/~r/Cato-at-liberty/~3/-OPIMm0JcAI/minimum-wage-unemployment-0</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;William Poole&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; line-height:
      1.3em;"&gt;Seventy-five economists, including seven Nobel
      winners, have &lt;a
      href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-01-14/seven-nobel-economists-endorse-10-dot-10-minimum-wage"&gt;signed
      a letter&lt;/a&gt; advocating an increase in the minimum
      wage. The letter was preceded by a &lt;em&gt;New York
      Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a
      href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/02/opinion/the-campaign-for-a-bigger-paycheck.html?_r=0"&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt;
      on January 2 making the same argument. I assume that there
      will be an opposing letter shortly, probably also including
      some Nobel signers. These minimum wage campaigns arise from
      time to time; this exchange is old hat, but worth reviewing
      briefly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The
      Economics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new letter
      claims that “&amp;#8230; the weight of evidence now show[s]
      that increases in the minimum wage have had little or no
      negative effect on the employment of minimum-wage workers
      &amp;#8230; .” Relatively few op-ed readers are economists,
      but anyone interested in the evidence should consider a 2007
      National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) &lt;a
      href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w12663.pdf?new_window=1"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;
      by David Neumark and William Wascher, “Minimum Wages and
      Employment: A Review of Evidence from the New Minimum Wage
      Research.” Here is the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We review the burgeoning
      literature on the employment effects of minimum wages - in
      the United States and other countries - that was spurred by
      the new minimum wage research beginning in the early 1990s.
      Our review indicates that there is a wide range of existing
      estimates and, accordingly, a lack of consensus about the
      overall effects on low-wage employment of an increase in the
      minimum wage. However, the oft-stated assertion that recent
      research fails to support the traditional view that the
      minimum wage reduces the employment of low-wage workers is
      clearly incorrect. A sizable majority of the studies surveyed
      in this monograph give a relatively consistent (although not
      always statistically significant) indication of negative
      employment effects of minimum wages. In addition, among the
      papers we view as providing the most credible evidence,
      almost all point to negative employment effects, both for the
      United States as well as for many other countries. Two other
      important conclusions emerge from our review. First, we see
      very few - if any - studies that provide convincing evidence
      of positive employment effects of minimum wages, especially
      from those studies that focus on the broader groups (rather
      than a narrow industry) for which the competitive model
      predicts disemployment effects. Second, the studies that
      focus on the least-skilled groups provide relatively
      overwhelming evidence of stronger disemployment effects for
      these groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is not
      hard to explain to the noneconomist why some studies suggest
      no effect of the minimum wage on employment. In the past,
      changes in the minimum wage have been relatively small.
      Trying to sort out the effects of the increase from
      everything else going on requires high-powered statistics,
      and even then the effects can be buried by a host of other
      simultaneous disturbances and influences.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;So, consider the following common-sense thought
      experiment: Suppose Congress were to enact a minimum wage $50
      higher than the current one of $7.25 per hour. Would a
      minimum of $57.25 reduce employment? I know of no economist
      who would assert a zero effect in this case, and recommend
      that readers ask their economist friends about this thought
      experiment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;
      line-height: 1.3em;"&gt;Assume that the estimate is that a
      minimum of $57.25 would reduce employment by 100,000. The
      actual number would be far higher but 100,000 will do for
      this thought experiment.&amp;nbsp;Now, consider several other
      possible increases of less than $50. The larger of these
      increases would have substantial effects, the smaller ones
      smaller effects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But is there
      reason to believe that a minimum of $10 would have no
      effect?&amp;nbsp;I have never seen a convincing argument to
      justify that belief. If you accept as a fact that a minimum
      wage of $57.25 would reduce employment, and you accept as a
      fact that some workers are currently paid $7.25 per hour,
      then logic compels you to believe that a small increase in
      the minimum wage above $7.25 will have at least a small
      negative effect on employment.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span style="font-size: 16px;
      line-height: 1.3em;"&gt;The only escape from this logic is to
      believe that there is a discontinuity in the relationship
      between the minimum wage and employment. No one has offered
      evidence that there is a discontinuity at a certain minimum
      wage such that a minimum above that has an effect and one
      below does not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A wage above
      $7.25 is readily available to anyone willing to move to
      low-unemployment area such as North Dakota. Instead of
      calling for a higher federal minimum wage, why not call for
      federal assistance helping workers to move to labor-short
      states?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ethics of a
      Minimum Wage Increase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If
      you accept that a small increase in the minimum wage will
      have some small negative effect on employment, then you need
      to consider the nature of the trade-off involved. Those who
      remain employed—and most workers will remain employed if the
      minimum wage increase is small—will enjoy the benefits of the
      higher wage and will thank the politicians who gave it to
      them. Those who lose employment will, most likely, not even
      realize that the minimum wage is the cause. Why? Because most
      firms will adjust by letting attrition run down staff size.
      Most minimum wage jobs are in industries with high turnover.
      Thus, few workers are fired; instead, some are not hired to
      replace workers turning over. Workers not hired are unlikely
      to have any idea as to the reason.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Who are
      the workers not hired? They are the least skilled, most
      disadvantaged members of society. The bottom line is that
      those who advocate an increase in the minimum wage are
      willing to trade the higher wages of those who remain
      employed for reduced employment opportunities for the least
      skilled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I finish with a personal story. I
      remember my father telling me of an effect from the minimum
      wage increase from $1.00 to $1.15 effective September 1961.
      The same legislation scheduled a further increase to $1.25 in
      September 1963. Dad described how the DuPont Company at that
      point decided to automate elevators in its office building in
      Wilmington, Delaware. The old elevators worked fine, but
      required an operator. Within a short time, all the elevators
      were automated and the operators of the old ones had no
      jobs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, even modest increases in the
      minimum wage will have similar effects. For example,
      fast-food restaurants will replace order takers with
      electronic order stations that accept cash and credit cards
      for payment and relay the orders directly to the
      kitchen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wish it were possible for
      today’s long-term unemployed to plead with the economists and
      editorial writers not to advocate a higher minimum wage. Will
      those advocating a higher minimum wage be willing meet face
      to face with disadvantaged members of society, who are
      willing and able to work, and explain why their employment
      needs to be sacrificed for higher wages for those who remain
      employed?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div

      <title>North Korean Politics as Blood Sport: China May Be a
      Target Too</title>
      <link>
      http://feeds.cato.org/~r/Cato-at-liberty/~3/tO2BGoAUBGc/north-korean-politics-blood-sport-china-may-be-target-too</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Doug Bandow&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;North
      Korea has never been an easy ally for the People’s Republic
      of China. With the execution of Jang Song-taek, Kim Jong-un’s
      uncle and supposed mentor, Beijing’s uncertain clout in
      Pyongyang is at risk.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Dear
      Leader” Kim Jong-il has been dead barely two years, but his
      son appears to have turned politics there into blood sport.
      While family members, including Jang under both Kim Il-sung
      and Kim Jong-il, were commonly sidelined, they never were
      publicly executed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now the game
      has changed. Although Kim appears to be in firm control, the
      circumstances are extraordinary. A quick execution is as much
      a sign of weakness as strength, suggesting the need to
      dispatch a dangerous rival who might gather support.
      Undertaking a broad and deadly purge creates not only
      uncertainty but desperation, which might spark unexpected
      resistance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a
      title="aoldb://mail/write/~$ina.NorthKorea.USTroops.041813.4.doc"
      href="aoldb://mail/write/~$ina.NorthKorea.USTroops.041813.4.doc"&gt;As
      I recently wrote in &lt;em&gt;US-China
      Focus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most obvious concern over the
      DPRK concerns a foreign policy which has gotten more erratic
      and confrontational since Kim Jong-il’s death. Kim regularly
      employed brinkmanship as policy, but always seemed to know
      just when to stop. Kim fils has demonstrated no such limits.
      His latest threat of war against South Korea went by fax to
      Seoul. The possibility of mistake or miscalculation seems
      much higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;There also
      is rising doubt as to the PRC’s ability to offer a moderating
      influence on Pyongyang. China’s relationship with the DPRK
      never has been easy. Still, Chinese energy and food aid has
      been essential, and most recently Chinese investment has
      provided the DPRK an economic lifeline.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There has been a recent hardening of attitudes in
      the PRC. Nevertheless, until now the North continued to seek
      support from China. But now Jang is gone.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Jang was widely thought to play an important role in
      economic affairs and place greater emphasis on economic
      development, which probably meant support for economic
      liberalization.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moreover, Jang had
      established a strong relationship with Chinese officials.
      Bilateral deal-making seemed to accelerate in Kim Jong-il’s
      final years, when Jang played an important leadership role.
      In 2012, the latter headed a large delegation which discussed
      expanding special investment zones with Beijing’s support.
      Many North Koreans linked to Jang were in business in the
      PRC.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is widely presumed that
      Jang was removed for political reasons. Yet the bill of
      particulars included several economic charges.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For instance, Jang was accused of having “seriously
      obstructed the nation’s economic affairs and the improvement
      of the standard of people’s living.”&amp;nbsp; Even more
      telling, Jang’s indictment includes the charge of “selling of
      precious resources of the country at cheap prices” and having
      “made no scruple of committing such act of treachery in May
      last as selling off the land of the Rason economic and trade
      zone to a foreign country for a period of five decades under
      the pretext of paying those debts.” Moreover, corruption was
      charged involving a 2011 project at
      Rason.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, China is the
      “foreign country” cited.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The charges could
      merely reflect a “kitchen sink” quality, but they seem too
      specific for Beijing’s comfort. So far nothing has obviously
      changed. New contracts have been signed and one North Korean
      economic official announced “It’s just the same as before.”
      Still, inertia might continue to govern, with change to come.
      Zhu Feng of Peking University observed: “the negative impact
      must be tremendous.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chinese with whom I
      spoke in early December admitted that they could only
      speculate. But if the North really is targeting Beijing along
      with Jang, relations could deteriorate quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;North Korea’s urge to purge should prompt rethinking
      in Beijing about the North Korea “problem.” The PRC should
      explore options with South Korea and America, including
      taking a much tougher policy toward the DPRK in return for
      allied attention to Chinese concerns over economic costs,
      refugee flows, and security issues. The North’s neighbors
      should work together to ensure a stable and peaceful future
      no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt; &lt;a

      <title>Orange Revolution Redux in the Ukraine: America Should
      Stay Out</title>
      <link>
      http://feeds.cato.org/~r/Cato-at-liberty/~3/xPHmGQYIO8c/orange-revolution-redux-ukraine-america-should-stay-out</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Doug Bandow&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nine
      years after the so-called Orange Revolution against electoral
      fraud, opponents of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich
      hope to stage a repeat.&amp;nbsp; But the issue today,
      whether Kiev aligns economically with Europe or Russia,
      doesn’t much concern the U.S.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In
      2004 the Orange Revolution helped deliver the presidency to
      Western-favorite Viktor Yushchenko, a disastrous
      incompetent.&amp;nbsp; Yanukovich narrowly won the 2009
      race.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He has been negotiating
      over an Association Agreement with the European
      Union.&amp;nbsp; However, Brussels demanded political
      concessions, most importantly the freeing of opposition
      leader Yulia Tymoshenko, who had been prosecuted by
      Yanukovich’s government, and refused to offer cash
      assistance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time
      Vladimir Putin pushed Kiev to forswear the EU and join the
      Moscow-led Customs Union.&amp;nbsp; And Moscow brought cash
      to the table.&amp;nbsp; To the consternation of Brussels,
      last month the Yanukovich government signed an accord with
      Russia—though without joining the CU.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Brussels and Washington were shocked,
      shocked.&amp;nbsp; New German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter
      Steinmeier said “It is utterly scandalous how Russia used
      Ukraine’s economic plight for its own ends.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Sen. John McCain visited Kiev, where he complained
      that “President Putin has pulled out all the stops to coerce,
      intimidate and threaten Ukraine away from Europe.”&amp;nbsp;
      Former Undersecretary of State Paula Dobriansky demanded “a
      broad range of measures, including WTO sanctions, Russian
      expulsion from the Group of Eight and even a boycott of the
      2014 Winter Olympics by political leaders, unless Moscow
      abandons its strong-arm tactics toward
      Kiev.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The hypocrisy is
      breathtaking.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After all, the EU
      was pushing Kiev into making political concessions and
      choosing Europe over Russia.&amp;nbsp; In return, the
      Europeans offered the prospect of economic gain through
      increased trade.&amp;nbsp; After Kiev said no European
      officials said billions in grants and loans would have been
      forthcoming had Ukraine signed with the
      EU.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a
      href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/dougbandow/2014/01/13/orange-revolution-redux-in-the-ukraine-the-u-s-should-stay-out-of-this-fight/"&gt;As
      I point out in my latest Forbes online
      column&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of
      course, Washington goes not one hour, let alone one day,
      without attempting to bribe or coerce another government to
      do something.&amp;nbsp; The American secretary of state
      circles the globe constantly lecturing other nations how to
      behave.&amp;nbsp; Since the end of the Cold War the U.S. has
      been the warrior state, routinely using military means to
      achieve its ends.&amp;nbsp; Indeed, Sen. McCain has variously
      supported war against Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Serbia,
      and Syria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Russia is
      guilty of heavy-handedness?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes, the West
      offers a better, freer path.&amp;nbsp; Which is why protests
      have broken out over Ukraine’s abandonment of the
      EU.&amp;nbsp; It’s fair for Washington to wish the critics
      well and warn Kiev against a violent
      response.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But why should
      Brussels or Washington meddle in the decision
      itself?&amp;nbsp; The &lt;em&gt;Wall Street
      Journal&lt;/em&gt; insisted that the Obama administration
      “stand up for America’s interests and values.”&amp;nbsp; But
      what are they in Ukraine?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs
      Victoria Nuland declared at the opposition rally in
      Kiev:&amp;nbsp; “the U.S. stands with you in your search for
      justice, for human dignity and security, for economic health,
      and the European future that you have chosen and
      deserve.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Washington should
      endorse justice and human dignity, which justifies support
      for honest elections and warnings against police
      brutality.&amp;nbsp; But Ukraine’s “economic health” and
      “European future” aren’t American values and are barely
      American interests.&amp;nbsp; How would Americans feel if
      Ukrainian politicians showed up at a Republican rally in
      Washington vowing to stand with protestors in the name of
      Ukrainian “interests and values”?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A
      stable, democratic Ukraine would be benefit all.&amp;nbsp;
      However, Russia’s activities in Ukraine do not threaten the
      U.S.&amp;nbsp; In contrast, bringing NATO up to Russia’s
      southern border could not help but be seen as threatening by
      Moscow—imagine the Warsaw Pact expanding to
      Mexico.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The West should
      acknowledge legitimate Russian interests in Ukraine, while
      offering new incentives for Kiev to look westward.&amp;nbsp;
      Moreover, Europe should seek compromise with
      Moscow.&amp;nbsp; Ukraine has proposed creation of “a
      tripartite commission to handle complex issues,” including
      greater links between the EU and the Russian-lead CU, which
      might reduce Moscow’s pressure on Kiev.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If
      Ukraine wants to look east, so be it.&amp;nbsp; Even with
      Russia’s money Yanukovich’s reelection prospects are weak and
      Ukraine is likely to eventually join the West.&amp;nbsp; If
      not, the country never was the EU’s or Washington’s to
      lose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt; &lt;a

      <title>The Minimum Wage: Immoral and Inefficient</title>
      <link>
      http://feeds.cato.org/~r/Cato-at-liberty/~3/zGdkYj78l74/minimum-wage-immoral-inefficient</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Doug Bandow&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Democratic politicians are desperate to make up for
      ObamaCare’s disastrous roll-out.&amp;nbsp; Thirteen states
      are increasing their minimums this year, and some Democrats
      believe raising the national minimum wage is a winning
      campaign issue for November.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s no
      doubt that raising the minimum wage would reduce employment
      and slow economic growth.&amp;nbsp; Worse, government
      wage-setting is immoral.&amp;nbsp; It is unfair and wrong for
      politicians to posture as philanthropists while forcing other
      people to pay higher salaries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first
      question is the minimum’s impact on employment and price
      levels.&amp;nbsp; The answer is clear:&amp;nbsp; the cost of
      higher wages will be borne in varying degrees by customers,
      workers, and investors.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a
      href="http://spectator.org/articles/57409/immoral-and-inefficient"&gt;As
      I wrote in the American Spectator:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;as Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman
      observed, there ain’t no such thing as a free
      lunch.&amp;nbsp; Arbitrarily raising the cost of labor—there
      is no principled basis for choosing any particular government
      minimum—will increase prices, reduce investor returns, and
      cut employment levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Most vulnerable are workers with the least
      education, experience, and skills, who tend to be young and
      minorities.&amp;nbsp; Forcing up wages will not only reduce
      overall employment, but shift jobs toward higher-skilled
      workers who are more productive and thus warrant higher
      pay.&amp;nbsp; The minimum wage also encourages
      mechanization, since it makes economic sense for companies to
      invest more in machines to spend less on
      labor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In effect, the minimum
      wage is a tax on labor-intensive companies.&amp;nbsp; No
      surprise, then, as &lt;a
      href="http://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/negative-effects-minimum-wage-laws"&gt;explained
      by Mark Wilson of Applied Economic Strategies in a Cato
      Institute Policy Analysis&lt;/a&gt;:&amp;nbsp; “The main
      finding of economic theory and empirical research over the
      past 70 years is that minimum wage increases tend to reduce
      employment.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The strangest claim
      may come from the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;, which
      editorialized:&amp;nbsp; “a higher wage would stimulate the
      economy without adding a dime to federal spending.”&amp;nbsp;
      However, to the extent raising the minimum increases the
      total amount of wages, it does so by
      &lt;em&gt;redistributing&lt;/em&gt; the money from other
      people, who end up with less to spend on
      consumption.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No doubt, the
      employment impact of a small increase, especially if salary
      levels have been rising, would be modest, which explains
      recent economic studies demonstrating lesser job
      loss.&amp;nbsp; But the less significant the increase, the
      less meaningful any potential benefit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In
      contrast, those who claim that raising today’s minimum would
      have no impact on employer behavior fail to demonstrate the
      courage of their convictions.&amp;nbsp; If government can
      hike wages without harm, why stop at $10 or $15 an
      hour?&amp;nbsp; Why not go to $1000 or $1500?&amp;nbsp; Then
      everyone in America could be rich at no cost to
      anyone!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet there is an even more
      fundamental issue.&amp;nbsp; The minimum wage is the modern
      perversion of compassion into coercion:&amp;nbsp; I believe
      there is a moral imperative for you to earn more, so I force
      someone else to pay more.&amp;nbsp; I feel moral while
      sticking someone else with the bill.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;However, if “we,” the citizens of America, believe
      people should earn more, then “we,” the citizens of America,
      not a few labor intensive businesses, should pay for those
      above-market wages.&amp;nbsp; Opposing the minimum wage is
      simple fairness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While many advocates no
      doubt are true believers, for some fairness talk is pure
      twaddle.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; John Cassidy wrote in the
      &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;nbsp; “In the current
      political environment, there is little chance of pushing
      through another hike in income-support programs.&amp;nbsp;
      Raising the minimum wage pushes the burden onto corporations
      and consumers.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Washington
      should be systematically reducing, not increasing, the cost
      of doing business.&amp;nbsp; Yet the regulatory-happy Obama
      Administration has been imposing multiple burdens on
      commerce, starting with ObamaCare.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The next time someone rises to support arbitrary
      government wage-setting, they should be asked what they are
      doing personally to help the economically
      disadvantaged.&amp;nbsp; Raiding the wallets of others does
      not count as compassion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div

      <title>Unanimous SCOTUS Decides Two Civil Procedure
      Cases</title>
      <link>
      http://feeds.cato.org/~r/Cato-at-liberty/~3/cjAM0_t25qo/unanimous-scotus-decides-two-civil-procedure-cases</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Walter Olson&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This
      morning the U.S. Supreme Court handed down two unanimous
      cases correcting appeals courts on issues of civil procedure.
      In &lt;a
      href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/12-1036_0971.pdf"&gt;Mississippi
      ex rel. Hood v. AU Optronics&lt;/a&gt;, it reversed a Fifth
      Circuit ruling that a consumer lawsuit by the state of
      Mississippi was enough like a class action that it should be
      heard in federal rather than state court under the procedures
      specified by the Class Action Fairness Act. In &lt;a
      href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/11-965_1qm2.pdf"&gt;Daimler
      AG v. Bauman et al&lt;/a&gt;, it reversed a Ninth Circuit
      ruling that because worldwide auto giant Daimler has
      operations in California, it can properly be sued in that
      state over alleged misconduct in Argentina that has nothing
      in particular to do with its California
      operations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Neither result is
      even remotely surprising (and&amp;nbsp;Cato did not file
      amicus briefs in either case).&amp;nbsp;In the AU Optronics
      case, CAFA&amp;#8217;s plain language supported the state of
      Mississippi&amp;#8217;s position, and arguments that removal
      was more consistent with the law&amp;#8217;s spirit added up
      to a plea for the business community (which identifies with
      the defendant side here) to get a better deal than it managed
      to get during the negotiations that led to the
      law&amp;#8217;s passage. In the Daimler case, the Court again
      confirmed, as in the Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum case
      discussed at length by &lt;a
      href="http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/supreme-court-review/2013/9/anderson.pdf"&gt;Kenneth
      Anderson in the latest Cato Supreme Court Review&lt;/a&gt;,
      that it is deeply out of sympathy with “universal
      jurisdiction” notions beloved in some parts of &lt;a
      href="http://books.google.com/books?id=YCWpwThUy5IC&amp;amp;pg=PA217&amp;amp;lpg=PA217&amp;amp;dq=%22schools+for+misrule%22+%22universal+jurisdiction%22&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=noXH-x0YPP&amp;amp;sig=sxNnRsP7_hWxleYe0oCSwJwKmjE&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=9WzVUtahPLWgsASAkoDAAw&amp;amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22schools%20for%20misrule%22%20%22universal%20jurisdiction%22&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;legal
      academia&lt;/a&gt; and the world of activist NGOs
      (non-governmental organizations), under which labeling
      something a “human rights” matter should open the way for
      suit to be brought over it in more or less any court
      anyplace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cases remind us that despite
      the various attacks on the Court as result-oriented and
      ideology-driven, much of its work consists simply of trying
      to keep the law on a logically coherent and predictable
      course. Anti-business activists couldn&amp;#8217;t win a
      single vote for their supposed human rights
      claims&amp;nbsp;in Daimler, just as their more radical claims
      had unanimously flopped in Kiobel. &amp;nbsp;By the same
      token the organized business community couldn&amp;#8217;t win
      a single Justice in AU Optronics, though it put a real effort
      into defending its Fifth Circuit victory. It&amp;#8217;s long
      past time for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) to apologize
      for&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
      href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/elizabeth-warren-supreme-court-far-right-96449.html"&gt;her
      demagogic portrayal of the Court&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;as headed
      toward a condition as “wholly owned subsidiary of Big
      Business”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

      <title>FCC to Make Internet Service a Public Utility</title>
      <link>
      http://feeds.cato.org/~r/Cato-at-liberty/~3/EtdpLCx3R04/fcc-make-internet-service-public-utiity</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jim Harper&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do you
      want your Internet service provider to operate like the water
      company or the electric company? Internet access services
      will be more like these leaden public utilities if the
      Federal Communications Commission tries one of the more
      likely workarounds to a D.C. Circuit Court decision today
      that restricts its authority to regulate.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The story is long and involved&amp;#8212;read it
      &lt;a
      href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/3AF8B4D938CDEEA685257C6000532062/$file/11-1355-1474943.pdf"&gt;in
      the court&amp;#8217;s opinion&lt;/a&gt; if you
      like&amp;#8212;but the FCC has sought for years now to
      regulate broadband Internet service providers something like
      it used to regulate AT&amp;amp;T, with government mandated
      terms of service if not tarriffs and price controls. This
      doesn&amp;#8217;t fit the technical environment of the
      Internet, which allows for diverse business models. Companies
      that experiment with network management, pricing, internal
      subsidy, and so on can find the configurations that serve
      widely varying consumers and their differing Internet needs
      the best. If government believes in &lt;a
      href="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2009/09/hov-lane-getty-630.jpg"&gt;fast
      lanes and slow lanes&lt;/a&gt;, surely Internet service
      providers could optimize service for movie delivery, video
      calling, and such, while email arrives a little less
      speedily.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The court found that the
      FCC&amp;#8217;s plans don&amp;#8217;t fit with its
      classification some years ago of broadband as an “information
      service,” subject to the light-touch regulation under Title I
      of the Communications Act. Title II, which applies to
      “telecommunications carriers,” allows common carrier
      regulation of the type the FCC is trying to impose. So watch
      for the FCC to conveniently change its mind and begin pushing
      for treatment of broadband once again as a
      “telecommunications service.” This is so it can have more
      control over the business decisions made by Internet service
      providers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We &lt;a
      href="http://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/durable-internet-preserving-network-neutrality-without-regulation"&gt;made
      the case more than five years ago&lt;/a&gt; that
      “&amp;#8201;‘Net neutrality” is a good engineering principle,
      but it shouldn&amp;#8217;t be a legal mandate. Technology and
      markets surpassed any need for command-and-control regulation
      in this area long ago. But regulators don&amp;#8217;t give up
      power without a fight. To maintain power, the FCC may try to
      make Internet service a public utility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div

      <title>Would Anti-Marijuana Activists Also Try to Keep
      Alcohol Illegal?</title>
      <link>
      http://feeds.cato.org/~r/Cato-at-liberty/~3/JxTtZf3LAlw/would-anti-marijuana-activists-also-try-keep-alcohol-illegal</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;David Boaz&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After I
      read the latest of Mitchell S. Rosenthal&amp;#8217;s tirades
      against drug legalization in the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street
      Journal&lt;/em&gt;, I must have fallen asleep and dreamed of
      a world in which marijuana is legal and alcohol is illegal.
      Not one of Coleridge&amp;#8217;s opium-induced dreams, alas,
      so I didn&amp;#8217;t wake up to write a &lt;a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubla_Khan"&gt;classic
      poem&lt;/a&gt;. But I did wonder what op-ed the
      &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; might publish in such a world if
      people began to agitate for the freedom to drink alcohol.
      With the help of Matthew LaCorte, I discovered you
      wouldn&amp;#8217;t have to change many words. I imagine it
      might go something like this:&lt;span style="line-height:
      1.3em;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s Not
      Kid Ourselves About Alcohol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Rose Ethel
      Mitchell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Booze is always
      good for a giggle, and that makes it hard to take alcohol
      seriously. The news and entertainment media
      couldn&amp;#8217;t resist puns on “LAX new rules” when
      California started the year with legal sales of alcohol for
      recreational purposes. TV stations across the country
      featured chuckling coverage of long lines outside the state’s
      new state-licensed liquor shops.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Legalizing alcohol isn&amp;#8217;t just amusing.
      It&amp;#8217;s increasingly popular with legislators and the
      public. And why not? No matter how drunk drinkers get,
      they&amp;#8217;re nowhere near as useless in society as lazy
      pot-heads, right? &amp;nbsp;Drinkers don’t clear all the
      munchies off the grocery shelves or grow their hair out like
      hippies. But studies show that, unlike pot, alcohol leads to
      violence and aggression, especially with friends or
      partners.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A recent study found that
      alcohol is more dangerous than such legal drugs as cannabis
      and Ecstasy. We should not be raising a glass to the coming
      acceptance of alcohol use and dependency. Alcohol is far from
      safe, despite the widespread effort to make it seem benign.
      Drinking damages the heart, increases the incidence of
      anxiety, depression and schizophrenia, and can trigger acute
      psychotic episodes. Many adults appear to be able to use
      alcohol with relatively little harm, but the same cannot be
      said of adolescents, who are about twice as likely as adults
      to become addicted to drinking. The new California law limits
      alcohol sales to people 21 or older, but making it available
      for recreational use normalizes it in society. The drug will
      be made more easily available to those under 21, and how long
      until the age limit is dropped to 18? Having some bubbly may
      enhance social interactions, but at what cost?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Adolescents are vulnerable—and not just to booze.
      That&amp;#8217;s how they are programmed. They make rash and
      risky choices because their brains aren&amp;#8217;t fully
      developed. The part of the brain that censors dumb or
      dangerous behavior is last to come on line (generally not
      before the mid-20s). Meanwhile, the brain&amp;#8217;s
      pleasure-seeking structures are up and running strong by
      puberty. When you link adolescent pleasure-seeking and
      risk-taking to liquor’s impairment of perception and
      judgment, it isn&amp;#8217;t surprising that a 2004 study of
      seriously injured drivers in Maryland found half the teens
      tested positive for booze.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Drinking
      impairs judgment—no small matter during the adolescent
      years—and it can do lasting harm to the brain. The National
      Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism has found that
      alcohol disrupts the brain’s communication pathways and can
      change mood and behavior, making it harder to think clearly
      and move with coordination. Long-term drinking can damage the
      heart, inflame the liver, increase risk of cancer, and weaken
      the immune system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most disturbing is a
      recent discovery about alcohol from the Center for Addiction
      and Mental Health which found alcohol is the third leading
      cause of disease around the world. The lead author wrote,
      “Alcohol consumption has been found to cause more than 200
      different diseases and injuries.” While New Yorkers are
      sipping their “Long Island iced tea” or vacationers are
      singing about tequila, the facts show that their bodies don’t
      think these drinks are going down smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Many experts are troubled by changing teen attitudes
      about drinking. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Half of adolescents have
      already tried illegal alcohol. Teen marijuana use and
      cigarette smoking have declined, and their abuse of
      prescription painkillers has fallen off sharply, but teen
      imbibing &amp;nbsp;continues to increase. &amp;nbsp;And a
      shocking 15% exhibit signs of alcoholism even in their teen
      years. This binge of facts will only worsen with legal
      alcohol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No one can say how liquor
      legalization will play out. A perception of legal alcohol as
      safe, combined with sophisticated marketing, may well double
      or triple drinking. Warning of aggressive promotion,
      alcohol-policy expert Luke Farmer, who studied potential
      issues of a legal alcohol market for the New York City
      Council, pointed out last year: “The only way to sell a lot
      of alcohol is to create a lot of alcoholics.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As we learn more about the realities of legalizing
      recreational booze, I suspect it won&amp;#8217;t seem so
      funny anymore. Remember, potheads used to be good for a laugh
      too. A spaced-out pothead was a staple of Hollywood comedies
      in the 1960s and &amp;#8217;70s. Smoking cigarettes was
      considered cool. The reality of wrecked lives and ruined
      health eventually changed public perceptions of these
      addictions. Now liquor is becoming more widely regarded as a
      harmless amusement. That&amp;#8217;s not funny,
      it&amp;#8217;s tragic. Drinkers may enjoy a Scotch on the
      rocks, but the social effects will be rocky for us
      all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s
      always hard to imagine a counterfactual. I wrote once about a
      world in which education was provided on the free market but
      shoes were produced and distributed by the government, and
      how people would have trouble imagining how a free market in
      shoes would work. In this case, however, we did go through an
      episode of substance prohibition, followed by legalization.
      And despite all the real problems created by alcohol use, we
      decided that a liberal system created fewer social problems
      than Prohibition. Surely we can imagine the same with regard
      to marijuana.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wasteful Federal Aid to the States</title>

      href="http://www.cato.org/publications/testimony/reducing-wasteful-federal-spending"&gt;In
      my testimony last week&lt;/a&gt; to the House Oversight
      Committee, I focused on aid-to-state programs as a major
      source of waste in the federal budget.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
      federal government spent about $560 billion on aid to the
      states in 2013, making it the third largest item in the
      budget after Social Security and defense. &lt;a
      href="http://www.downsizinggovernment.org/fiscal-federalism"&gt;The
      aid system includes more than 1,100 different
      programs&lt;/a&gt; for education, housing, community
      development, and many other things.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
      aid-to-state system is rife with waste and inefficiency. So I
      was not surprised to see that many of the 100 programs in
      &lt;a
      href="http://www.coburn.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?a=Files.Serve&amp;amp;File_id=d204730e-4a24-4711-b1db-99bb6c29d4b6"&gt;Senator
      Tom Coburn’s new wastebook&lt;/a&gt; are aid programs.
      Federal aid stimulates overspending by state and local
      governments and encourages them to put money into dubious
      projects that they would not spend their own money
      on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are some of the wasteful
      aid-to-state projects profiled by Coburn and his expert
      staff:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;$1 million for a
      gold-plated bus stop in Arlington, Virginia&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;$50 million for a fancy parking lot (“transit
      center”) in Maryland that has quintupled in cost&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;$65 million for New York and New Jersey to
      advertise that they are (supposedly) good places to do
      business&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;$3.5 million for a New
      Hampshire airport to buy solar panels, which will save less
      than the cost of the project, and which are creating
      dangerous glare for pilots&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;$67 million
      for the Alaska Bridge to Nowhere&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;$195,000 from a substance-abuse program to throw a
      Hollywood party&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;$8 million for an
      unfinished, unneeded, and overbudget transportation
      conference center—which is named after a congressman—at South
      Carolina State University&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;$140,000 in
      housing aid to fix up some random house in Patterson, New
      Jersey, on which the city already spent $260,000, and which
      is only worth $171,000&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;$3.9 million on a
      tiny airport in St. Cloud, Minnesota, which has no daily
      commercial service&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;$1.25 million for the
      State of Florida to settle a lawsuit with one of its
      contractors&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;$532,000 to beautify one
      block on main street in Rossville, Kansas (pop. 1,150), which
      Google streetview indicates is a rather empty
      place&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;$30 million for “coastal
      conservation” in Mississippi, which is partly being spent on
      non-conservation items such as an art museum&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;$800,000 for Las Vegas to award a prize to someone
      who has a good economic development idea&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;$368,000 of “community development” money to an
      electric golf cart maker in Montana.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The money for all of these projects initially flows
      to Washington from taxpayers who live in the 50 states. It
      travels through the federal bureaucracies and funds generous
      salaries for many paper pushers, and then a reduced amount
      flows back to chosen state and local governments. Those
      governments treat the funding coming from the distant
      national capital as free, and they proceed to fritter it away
      on low-value and often hare-brained public and private
      schemes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that the
      federal aid system is a roundabout and inefficient funding
      method for state, local, and private activities. Cutting aid
      programs would be a great way to reduce government
      waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt; &lt;a

      href="http://www.cato.org/blog/tags/global-science-report"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Global
      Science Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a feature
      from the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a
      href="http://www.cato.org/projects.php#css"
      target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Center for the Study of
      Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, where we highlight
      one or two important new items in the scientific literature
      or the popular media. For broader and more technical
      perspectives, consult our monthly “Current
      Wisdom.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a
      href="https://www.federalregister.gov/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Federal
      Register&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has been brimming with
      announcements of government activities aimed to
      reduce/regulate carbon dioxide emissions emanating from the
      United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You may wonder why the
      government finds the need to pursue such action since 1) U.S.
      carbon dioxide emissions have already topped out and have
      generally been on the &lt;a
      href="http://www.cato.org/blog/thanks-natural-gas-climate-change-us-carbon-dioxide-emissions-continue-downward-trend"&gt;decline&lt;/a&gt;
      for the past 7-8 years or so (from technological advances in
      natural gas extraction and a slow economy&lt;a
      href="http://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/carbon/pdf/2012_co2analysis.pdf"&gt;
      more so&lt;/a&gt; than from already- enacted government
      regulations and subsidies); 2) greenhouse gases from the rest
      of the world (primarily driven by China) have been &lt;a
      href="http://www.cato.org/blog/us-greenhouse-gas-follies"&gt;sky-rocketing&lt;/a&gt;
      over the same period, which lessens any impacts that our
      emissions reduction have); and 3) even in their totality,
      U.S. carbon dioxide emissions have a negligible influence on
      local/regional/global climate change (even a immediate and
      permanent cessation of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; our carbon
      dioxide emissions would likely result in a mitigation of
      global temperature rise of less than &lt;a
      href="http://www.cato.org/blog/carbon-tax-follies"&gt;one-quarter&lt;/a&gt;
      of a degree C by the end of the century).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We wonder the same thing. Nevertheless, the
      government has lots of ideas for how to save ourselves from
      ourselves (with likely to opposite outcome).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Here is a summary of new announcements appearing in
      the &lt;em&gt;Federal Register&lt;/em&gt; over the past month
      or so on actions aimed to curtail our carbon dioxide
      emissions (primarily the result of our desire for cheap and
      reliable energy—gasp!).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Posted &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a
      href="https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2013/11/26/2013-28242/technical-support-document-technical-update-of-the-social-cost-of-carbon-for-regulatory-impact"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November
      26,
      2013&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
      The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) announced a call
      for review of the Technical Support Document currently
      justifying the Administration’s value of the social cost of
      carbon (SCC) used in federal cost/benefit analyses.&amp;nbsp;
      We have discussed this announcement &lt;a
      href="http://www.cato.org/blog/victory-cato-feds-now-seeking-input-social-cost-carbon"&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt;,
      and while it provides a glimmer of hope for injecting some
      new science and common sense into the government’s social
      cost of carbon, we are highly skeptical of a positive
      outcome. We mention the announcement again here, because the
      public comment period ends on January 27, 2014.&amp;nbsp;
      Comments can be submitted &lt;a
      href="http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=OMB-2013-0007-0001"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Posted &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a
      href="https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2013/12/06/2013-28776/energy-conservation-program-energy-conservation-standards-for-commercial-and-industrial-electric"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December
      6, 2013&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: The Department of Energy
      announced another in its seemingly endless string of
      intrusions into our personal choices through its energy
      efficiency requirement updates for all sorts of consumer
      products. These revised efficiency regulations rely on the
      SCC to offset the costs and enrich the apparent benefits of
      the new requirements. We have already submitted comments on
      several of these proposed regulations (from &lt;a
      href="http://www.cato.org/publications/public-comments/energy-conservation-program-energy-conservation-standards-walk-coolers"&gt;walk-in
      refrigerators&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a
      href="http://www.cato.org/publications/public-comments/energy-conservation-program-energy-conservation-standards-residential"&gt;furnace
      fans&lt;/a&gt;), but they just keep on coming.&amp;nbsp; The
      latest pertains to commercial and electric motors. Final
      comments are due February 4, 2014 and con be submitted &lt;a
      href="https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2013/12/06/2013-28776/energy-conservation-program-energy-conservation-standards-for-commercial-and-industrial-electric"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Posted &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a
      href="https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2013/12/31/2013-31273/energy-conservation-program-for-consumer-products-landmark-legal-foundation-petition-for"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December
      31, 2013&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: The Department of Energy
      (DoE) announced that it has declined a Petition for
      Reconsideration of its rule updating the energy conservation
      standards for of microwave ovens.&amp;nbsp; The Petition for
      Reconsideration was brought by the Landmark Legal Foundation
      which pointed out that the DoE used a social cost of carbon
      estimate in the cost/benefits analysis for the rule that had
      not been subject to public comment and which was some 50%
      higher than the value used in the C/B analysis that
      &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; available for public
      comment.&amp;nbsp; In other words, the DoE pulled a pretty
      big bait and switch.&amp;nbsp; We at the Cato’s Center for
      the Study of Science submitted &lt;a
      href="http://www.cato.org/publications/public-comments/energy-conservation-program-consumer-products-landmark-legal-foundation"&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt;
      on the Landmark Petition pointing out just how far afield
      from the actual science that the Administrations SCC estimate
      had become.&amp;nbsp; The denial was disappointing, but the
      fight over the proper value for the SCC has now moved to the
      OMB (as described above).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Posted
      &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a
      href="https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2014/01/08/2013-28668/standards-of-performance-for-greenhouse-gas-emissions-from-new-stationary-sources-electric-utility"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January
      8, 2014&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Last, but certainly not
      least, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
      announced its new proposed rule “Standards of Performance for
      Greenhouse Gas Emissions From New Stationary Sources:
      Electric Utility Generating Units.” This is the second
      iteration of the EPA’s rule which effectively seeks to
      prohibit the construction of any new coal-fired power plants.
      The Administration/EPA made a big splash back in September
      when they announced the details of the plan to the press, but
      it didn’t clear all the necessary hurdles to make it official
      until last week. The public comment period on the major piece
      of intrusive legislation is only open for 60 days, ending on
      March 10, 2014 (comments should be submitted &lt;a
      href="http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=EPA-HQ-OAR-2013-0495-0001"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).
      The EPA’s initial proposal limiting carbon dioxide emissions
      from new power plants, announced back in April 2012, received
      more than 2.5 million comments. When the EPA announced the
      new proposed rule, the EPA withdrew the old one and announced
      that it was not going to consider any of the comments
      submitted on the original proposal. This despite the fact the
      new proposed rule is grounded in the same (faulty) science as
      the original&amp;nbsp; and has effectively the same impact on
      coal-plants.&amp;nbsp; Substantially nothing changed, but the
      EPA is requiring a redo of the substantial effort that it
      takes to file comments on such a broad proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is probably just the tip of the iceberg.
      Undoubtedly there will be major federal announcement to come
      of rules and regulations aimed at reducing carbon dioxide
      emissions—in fact, the Administration has already promised a
      proposal to limit CO2 emissions from &lt;a
      href="http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/06/obama-climate-speech-georgetown"&gt;&lt;em&gt;existing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
      power plants. If you think the fight over regulations
      covering new power plants is contentious (with its 2.5
      million comments and all), just wait until that one is
      proposed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We see busy times for us
      ahead!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div

      <title>Our Broken Judicial Nominations Process</title>
      <link>
      http://feeds.cato.org/~r/Cato-at-liberty/~3/kYHMhiqMqvY/our-broken-judicial-nominations-process</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jason Kuznicki&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This
      month at&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Cato Unbound&lt;/em&gt;,
      we&amp;#8217;re discussing &lt;a
      href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/issues/january-2014/are-judicial-nominations-broken-how-should-we-fix-them"&gt;the
      federal judicial nominations process&lt;/a&gt;: Is it broken?
      (Spoiler: Yes!) How did it get that way? And what can be done
      to fix it?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our lead essayist is
      John R. Lott, Jr., author of the new book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a
      href="http://www.amazon.com/Dumbing-Down-Courts-Politics-Smartest/dp/1626522499/"&gt;Dumbing
      Down the Courts: How Politics Keeps the Smartest Judges Off
      the Bench&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a
      href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/2014/01/13/john-r-lott-jr/how-courts-got-dumbed-down"&gt;His
      lead essay charges that the growth of the federal
      government&amp;#8217;s regulatory reach has raised the stakes
      in the judicial nominaitons process&lt;/a&gt;: Now
      it&amp;#8217;s a much graver matter when the other
      party&amp;#8217;s judges end up on the bench &amp;#8211;
      particularly if the nominees in question are especially smart
      and persuasive. Lott writes:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think that attending a top
      university and graduating at the top of the class is the key
      to your success? Not if you’re headed for a federal
      judgeship. In fact, today the most accomplished candidates
      are the most likely to be rejected. And this phenomenon has
      only gotten worse, with the quality of judges declining over
      the last four decades&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A smart,
      persuasive judge might convince other judges to change their
      votes on a case. Judges who can write powerfully worded
      decisions also are more likely to be cited more frequently in
      other judges’ decisions and to influence their
      decisions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The president wants to nominate
      influential judges to successfully push the positions he
      values. His political opponents, however, naturally fear such
      judges—and, therefore, vehemently oppose their
      appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Agree?
      Disagree? We&amp;#8217;ll see some of each this month
      at&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Cato Unbound&lt;/em&gt;, and we invite
      you to follow the conversation as it develops. Coming up
      we&amp;#8217;ll have essays&amp;nbsp;&lt;span

      for Liberty and the Volunteer Military</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Doug Bandow&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With
      most people focused on the coming of Christmas, the death of
      economist Walter Oi received little attention.&amp;nbsp;
      Educated at the University of Chicago and appointed professor
      at the University of Rochester, Oi was an outstanding labor
      economist.&amp;nbsp; He was no mere ivory tower advocate of
      liberty.&amp;nbsp; He was a Nisei, or second-generation
      Japanese-American.&amp;nbsp; At age 13 during World War II
      his family was interned in California.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Life didn’t get easier for him.&amp;nbsp; His
      eyesight steadily deteriorated, and he could not read text
      upon entering college.&amp;nbsp; He fully lost his sight in
      1956.&amp;nbsp; Yet he went on to gain a PhD, teach,
      research, serve on presidential commissions, and gain a long
      list of honors.&amp;nbsp; His career should embarrass the
      rest of us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moreover, like Cato’s late
      chairman, Bill Niskanen, Oi stood on principle irrespective
      of cost.&amp;nbsp; In warm tribute to the latter, &lt;a
      href="http://www.hoover.org/publications/defining-ideas/article/164881"&gt;economist
      David Henderson, a University of Rochester colleague and
      another Cato Institute friend, pointed to&lt;/a&gt; Oi’s
      criticism of the future prospects for agriculture when
      teaching at Iowa State University and opposition to proposals
      for government reparations for the internment of
      Japanese-Americans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oi’s research
      interests were many but, Henderson wrote:&amp;nbsp; “If you
      are an American male younger than 66, you should take a
      moment and give thanks to economist Walter Oi.&amp;nbsp;
      Walter died on Christmas Eve 2013.&amp;nbsp; Even though you
      probably haven’t heard of him, he has had a profound effect
      on your life.&amp;nbsp; He helped end military conscription
      in the United States.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am one of those
      who was able to choose my own way, rather than be subject to
      presidential diktat and sent off to fight in a stupid,
      unnecessary foreign war.&amp;nbsp; Tens of thousands of
      Americans would have been alive had the draft not been
      available in the 1960s to provide a guaranteed supply of
      cannon fodder for Lyndon Johnson’s and Richard Nixon’s
      misadventure in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many people
      played critical roles in causing this self-proclaimed free
      society to rely on a free people for its defense.&amp;nbsp;
      Richard Nixon, who proposed the All-Volunteer
      Force.&amp;nbsp; Martin Anderson, for whom I later worked in
      the Reagan White House, who convinced Nixon to tackle the
      issue.&amp;nbsp; Milton Friedman, who served on the famous
      “Gates Commission,” which recommended the shift.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And Walter Oi, who served as a staff economist on
      the latter panel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As Henderson, who now
      educates military officers at the Naval Postgraduate School,
      explained, Oi’s “&lt;em&gt;passion&lt;/em&gt; for free labor
      markets was what motivated his work on the draft.&amp;nbsp;
      His &lt;em&gt;contribution&lt;/em&gt; was to point out—and
      estimate two costs.&amp;nbsp; First, there was the hidden
      cost imposed on draftees and ‘draft-induced’ or ‘reluctant’
      volunteers.&amp;nbsp; …&amp;nbsp; The second cost Oi
      estimated was the increased annual budget outlay needed to
      eliminate the draft.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The AVF obviously
      was a moral triumph.&amp;nbsp; It also turned out to be a
      practical achievement.&amp;nbsp; The military did far better
      recruiting people who wanted to serve than impressing those
      who only wanted out.&amp;nbsp; Today America has the finest
      military it has ever fielded, and the best in the
      world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a
      href="http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa430.pdf"&gt;As
      I wrote in a Cato Policy Analysis&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, a draft would degrade the
      military’s performance, requiring induction of less-qualified
      personnel, who are rejected today, and raising the rate of
      ‘indiscipline’ by filling the armed services with people who
      don’t want to serve.&amp;nbsp; It comes as no surprise that
      the military leadership opposes
      conscription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Walter Oi
      was &lt;em&gt;sui generis&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp; He personally
      suffered from tyrannical though democratic
      government.&amp;nbsp; He overcame disability without
      complaint.&amp;nbsp; He risked job and opposed government
      benefits because he valued honesty and principle.&amp;nbsp;
      He backed his commitment to liberty with wide-ranging and
      quality economic research.&amp;nbsp; And he made a huge
      difference in the lives of tens of millions of his
      countrymen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;RIP Walter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div

      <title>The Common Coring of Private Schools</title>
      <link>
      http://feeds.cato.org/~r/Cato-at-liberty/~3/WQzpwbV0sgc/common-coring-private-schools</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jason Bedrick&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today,
      the Fordham Institute released a “&lt;a
      href="http://www.edexcellence.net/publications/public-accountability-private-school-choice"&gt;policy
      toolkit&lt;/a&gt;” proposing private schools be required to
      administer state tests to all students participating in a
      school choice program, and publicize the results. Private
      schools that the state deemed persistently underperforming
      would be expelled from the program.&amp;nbsp;Fordham argues
      that such measures have the potential to raise student
      achievement and provide parents with the information needed
      to make better decisions about their children’s
      education.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;
      line-height: 1.3em;"&gt;Though Fordham’s plan is
      well-intentioned, their justifications are unpersuasive and
      their proposal is more likely to do harm than
      good.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Little
      Evidence to Support a Testing Mandate for Private
      Schools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, there is
      scant evidence to support Fordham’s claim that test-based
      accountability measures “may boost student achievement.”
      Fordham rests its claim on the results of but a single year
      in a single study of a single school choice program: the
      final year of the School Choice Demonstration Project’s
      five-year analysis of the Milwaukee voucher
      program.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the first four years of
      the study, voucher students took a low-stakes test, but in
      the final year of the study, policymakers increased the
      stakes by mandating that the test results be publicized and
      the scores improved. Fordham argues that this proves that
      high-stakes testing improves performance but one of the
      study’s authors, Dr. Patrick Wolf of the University of
      Arkansas, has previously &lt;a
      href="http://jaypgreene.com/2013/07/19/this-time-it-counts/"&gt;cautioned&lt;/a&gt;
      the Fordham Institute against reading too much into that
      finding, calling it “enticing and suggestive but hardly
      conclusive”:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we point
      out in the report, it is entirely possible that the surge in
      the test scores of the voucher students was a “one-off” due
      to a greater focus of the voucher schools on test preparation
      and test-taking strategies that year.&amp;nbsp; In other
      words, by taking the standardized testing seriously in that
      final year, the schools simply may have produced a truer
      measure of student’s actual (better) performance all along,
      not necessarily a signal that they actually learned a lot
      more in the one year under the new accountability
      regime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;But even if the
      was no question that the higher test scores actually
      reflected increased performance, it would still only be one
      study. When Fordham cited this study as support for its
      proposal six months ago, Andrew J. Coulson &lt;a
      href="http://www.cato.org/blog/education-policy-use-evidence-fordham-institute"&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A single study, no matter how
      carefully executed, is not a scientific basis for policy.
      Because a single study is not science. Science is a process
      of making and testing falsifiable predictions. It is about
      patterns of evidence. Bodies of evidence. Fordham offers only
      a toe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;By contrast,
      there is a significant &lt;a
      href="http://www.edchoice.org/Research/Reports/A-Win-Win-Solution--The-Empirical-Evidence-on-School-Choice.aspx"&gt;body
      of evidence&lt;/a&gt; that school choice programs work
      without Fordham’s sought-after government regulation. Of
      twelve randomized controlled trials—the gold standard of
      social science research—eleven found that school choice
      programs improve outcomes for some or all students while only
      one found no statistically significant difference and none
      found a negative impact. None of these school choice programs
      studied were designed along the lines of the Fordham
      proposal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, Fordham’s preferred
      policy
      is&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;undermined&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;by a
      large body of evidence. A 2009 literature review of
      the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
      href="http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/articles/10.1.1.175.6495.pdf"&gt;within-country
      studies comparing outcomes among different types of school
      systems worldwide&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;revealed that the most
      market-like and least regulated education systems tended to
      produce student outcomes superior to more heavily regulated
      systems, including those with a substantial number
      state-funded and regulated private schools. In short, the
      best form of accountability is directly to parents, not
      government bureaucrats and their tests.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accountability
      Should Be To Parents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Fordham argues that school choice programs,
      including both vouchers and scholarship tax credits, should
      fall under the same accountability regimes as public schools
      because they utilize public funds. In Fordham&amp;#8217;s
      words, “&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; line-height:
      1.3em;"&gt;The taxpayer also needs assurances that schools
      are producing solid learning results for the children who
      participate in such programs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
      style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.3em;"&gt;” This
      reasoning should not apply to scholarship tax credits which,
      as the U.S. Supreme Court
      held&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em
      style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.3em;"&gt;&lt;a
      href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/09-987.ZO.html"
      target="_blank"&gt;ACSTO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a
      href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/09-987.ZO.html"
      target="_blank"&gt;v.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a
      href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/09-987.ZO.html"
      target="_blank"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Winn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span
      style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.3em;"&gt;, do not
      involve public funds at all:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like contributions that lead to
      charitable tax deductions, contributions yielding
      [scholarship] tax credits are not owed to the State and, in
      fact, pass directly from taxpayers to private organizations.
      Respondents’ contrary position assumes that income should be
      treated as if it were government property even if it has not
      come into the tax collector’s hands. That premise finds no
      basis in standing jurisprudence. Private bank accounts cannot
      be equated with the … State
      Treasury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;But even in
      the case of direct government subsidies, it&amp;#8217;s far
      from clear that accountability to government is necessary or
      even prudent, as Professor Jay P. &amp;nbsp;Greene of the
      University of Arkansas &lt;a
      href="http://jaypgreene.com/2013/11/20/stop-requiring-choice-programs-to-take-state-test/"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most state funded programs require
      no formal accountability to the state and instead rely
      primarily on the self-interest of the recipients to use the
      funds wisely. &amp;nbsp;For example, the largest domestic
      program, social security, is designed to prevent seniors from
      lacking basic resources for housing, food, or clothing.
      &amp;nbsp;But we don’t demand that seniors account for the
      use of their social security checks. &amp;nbsp;They could
      blow it at the casino if they want. &amp;nbsp;We’re just
      counting on the fact that most would have the good sense to
      make sure that their basic needs are covered first.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Even in the area of education most government
      programs require no formal accountability. &amp;nbsp;Pell
      Grants, Stafford Loans, and the Daycare Tuition Tax Credit do
      not require state testing for people using those funds.
      &amp;nbsp;We just trust that the public purpose of
      subsidizing education will be served by people pursuing their
      own interests. [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t parents
      need state testing requirements for consumer protection and
      to get information to make intelligent choices?
      &amp;nbsp;Most markets generate consumer information without
      government mandates for them to do so. &amp;nbsp;For example,
      I have more information than you can imagine to pick a hotel
      or restaurant through Trip Advisor, Yelp, Urban Spoon, etc…
      &amp;nbsp;&lt;a
      href="http://www.greatschools.org/"&gt;GreatSchools.org&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and
      other market sources of information about education are
      already springing up as choice expands without government
      mandates. &amp;nbsp;But if you still feel the need to require
      testing, why not just require choice schools to take any one
      of a large number of standardized tests? &amp;nbsp;At least
      that way we place fewer restrictions on the curriculum
      schools could pursue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Indeed, a recent &lt;a
      href="http://www.edchoice.org/CMSModules/EdChoice/FileLibrary/1031/More-Than-Scores.pdf"&gt;Friedman
      Foundation report&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;showed that parents
      actively seek out relevant information before choosing a
      school and are less likely to enroll their children in
      schools that will not provide them with the information they
      seek. However, barely more than half of the survey
      respondents said that standardized test scores are
      “important” and&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; line-height:
      1.3em;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;barely 10% listed “performance on
      standardized tests” as one of their top five reasons for
      choosing a school. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style="font-size: 16px; line-height:
      1.3em;"&gt;Uniform Testing Mandates Stifle Diversity and
      Innovation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the
      benefit of Fordham’s proposal is dubious, the harm is more
      certain. By forcing every school to administer the same
      tests, states would induce conformity and stifle diversity
      and innovation. Fordham partially concedes that this is a
      concern, noting that if there is “a downside to this
      proposal, this is it.” However, they minimize the concern by
      claiming that the standards “only provide an endpoint” but do
      not prescribe a curriculum.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though the
      tests do not dictate curriculum per se, they create a
      powerful incentive for schools to teach the same concepts in
      the same order at the same time. This would make it all but
      impossible for schools to experiment with new ways of
      tailoring education to meet the needs of individual children,
      rather than expecting that all children who happened to be
      born in the same year should progress at the same rate across
      subjects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Common Core is already moving
      the nation’s education system toward greater uniformity. If
      states adopt Fordham’s proposal, they would almost entirely
      eliminate any viable alternative to the Common Core regime.
      As Professor Greene&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
      href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970204603004577269231058863616"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such uniformity would only make
      sense if: 1) there was a single best way for all students to
      learn; 2) we knew what it was; 3) we could be sure the people
      running this nationalized education system would adopt that
      correct approach; and 4) they would remain in charge far into
      the future. But that isn&amp;#8217;t how things are. There is
      no consensus on what all students need to know. Different
      students can best be taught and assessed in different
      ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial Incentives Would Leave
      Private Schools Little Choice But To
      Conform&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fordham also
      downplays the likely effect of their proposed regulations by
      assuring that they “won’t scare away [private] schools,”
      citing a &lt;a
      href="http://edexcellencemedia.net/publications/2013/20130129-School-Choice-Regulations-Red-Tape-or-Red-Herring/20130129-School-Choice-Regulations-Red-Tape-or-Red-Herring-EMBARGOED.pdf"&gt;previous
      Fordham study&lt;/a&gt; which found that most private schools
      would participate in a school choice program even if that
      meant accepting such regulations. But Fordham’s finding
      actually reveals the gravity of the concern.&amp;nbsp;Again,
      Coulson &lt;a
      href="http://educationnext.org/the-real-problem-with-highly-regulated-school-choice/"&gt;addressed
      this argument&lt;/a&gt; months ago:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is not that private
      schools&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;participate
      in heavily regulated school choice programs. The problem is
      that they&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt;. Hold-outs will
      be in the minority, and will gradually be driven out of
      business by their subsidized counterparts due to the uneven
      fiscal playing field (much as America’s once-dominant private
      schools were marginalized by the spread of “free” state-run
      schools).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We know this because there is
      extensive evidence to that effect from all over the world
      and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
      href="http://www.amazon.com/Market-Education-History-IDGs-Visual/dp/0765804964"
      target="_blank"&gt;across history&lt;/a&gt;. Everywhere that
      private elementary and secondary schools are eligible for
      government subsidies, the share of unsubsidized school
      enrollment falls. The higher the subsidy and the longer it
      has been in place, the more the unsubsidized sector is
      generally diminished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If state governments follow Fordham’s advice and
      expand their authority over private schools, even Fordham
      will likely come to regret it. Ultimately, it won’t be
      Fordham’s friends who are always and everywhere in charge,
      but the teachers unions and other vested interests. As
      Professor Greene warned, “Minority religions
      shouldn&amp;#8217;t favor building national churches because
      inevitably it won&amp;#8217;t be their gospel being
      preached.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt; &lt;a

      <title>A Governor's Warped Priorities</title>
      <link>
      http://feeds.cato.org/~r/Cato-at-liberty/~3/CS2Vk_1gVuU/governors-warped-priorities</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jason Bedrick&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
      governor of New Hampshire just submitted an &lt;a
      href="http://www.governor.nh.gov/media/news/2014/pr-2014-01-13-amicus-brief.htm"&gt;amicus
      brief&lt;/a&gt; in the lawsuit against the “Live Free or Die”
      state&amp;#8217;s scholarship tax credit program. Last year,
      Governor Maggie Hassan unsuccessfully &lt;a
      href="http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/killing-school-choice-hurts-poor-families"&gt;sought
      its repeal&lt;/a&gt;. The brief offers nothing new in the way
      of legal arguments. As with the &lt;a
      href="http://www.cato.org/blog/aclu-attacks-educational-freedom-live-free-or-die-state"&gt;ACLU&lt;/a&gt;
      and, unfortunately, &lt;a
      href="http://www.cato.org/blog/new-hampshire-courts-school-choice-decision-was-flawed-unprecedented"&gt;the
      trial court judge&lt;/a&gt;, the governor&amp;#8217;s brief
      tries to imagine a constitutional difference between tax
      credits and tax deductions and absurdly assumes that money
      that a private corporation donated to a private nonprofit
      that financially assists private citizens sending their
      children to private schools is somehow “public” money because
      the state &lt;em&gt;could have&lt;/em&gt; collected it in
      taxes had the legislature so decided. This claim contradicts
      both logic and the U.S. Supreme Court&amp;#8217;s
      holding&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a
      href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/09-987.ZO.html"
      target="_blank"&gt;ACSTO &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a
      href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/09-987.ZO.html"
      target="_blank"&gt;v.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a
      href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/09-987.ZO.html"
      target="_blank"&gt; Winn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like contributions that lead to
      charitable tax deductions, contributions yielding
      [scholarship] tax credits are not owed to the State and, in
      fact, pass directly from taxpayers to private organizations.
      Respondents’ contrary position assumes that income should be
      treated as if it were government property even if it has not
      come into the tax collector’s hands. That premise finds no
      basis in standing jurisprudence. Private bank accounts cannot
      be equated with the &amp;#8230; State
      Treasury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Cato
      Institute submitted an &lt;a
      href="http://www.cato.org/publications/legal-briefs/duncan-v-new-hampshire"&gt;amicus
      brief&lt;/a&gt; defending the constitutionality of the
      program back in November.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s
      noteworthy here is not the legal reasoning, but the
      governor&amp;#8217;s chutzpah. First, as the &lt;em&gt;Union
      Leader&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a
      href="http://www.unionleader.com/article/20130224/OPINION01/130229583"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt;,
      “Hassan is pushing state-funded, need-based scholarships for
      college students while trying to eliminate need-based
      scholarships for students in grades K-12.” The
      governor&amp;#8217;s amicus brief does not explain why direct
      public expenditures that students can use at a Catholic
      college are perfectly constitutional but a low-income student
      using a tax-credit scholarships at a religious elementary or
      secondary school would, as her amicus brief melodramatically
      puts it, “&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; line-height:
      1.3em;"&gt;jeopardize both the
      hallowed&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:
      16px; line-height: 1.3em;"&gt;underpinnings of religious
      tolerance and freedom, and the prohibition
      against&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:
      16px; line-height: 1.3em;"&gt;entanglement made sacred by
      [the] New Hampshire
      Constitution.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Second, Hassan is a strong proponent of &lt;a
      href="http://www.governor.nh.gov/media/news/2013/pr-2013-03-21-research-development.htm"&gt;“research
      and development” tax credits&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that pick
      winners and losers among certain types of businesses and
      business activities, thereby distorting the market. Moreover,
      by the governor&amp;#8217;s faulty logic, these tax credits
      constitute direct subsidies of public funds to profit-seeking
      entities.&amp;nbsp;R&amp;amp;D tax credits clearly reduce
      state revenue to fund activities that businesses are
      generally doing anyway for their own financial self-interest.
      &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By contrast, scholarship tax
      credits expand the market for private education without
      distorting it. Parents pick winners and losers among schools
      rather than the government. The corporations who receive the
      85 percent tax credits do not benefit financially &amp;#8211;
      indeed, they&amp;#8217;d be better off financially had they
      not donated at all. Moreover, the Josiah Bartlett Center
      &lt;a
      href="http://www.jbartlett.org/school-choice-scholarship-program-saves-8-million-over-next-two-state-budgets"&gt;projected&lt;/a&gt;
      that, if fully utilized, the scholarship tax credits would
      save New Hampshire taxpayers millions of dollars in the long
      run by reducing state expenditures by more than they would
      reduce state tax revenue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In short,
      Governor&amp;nbsp;Hassan supports corporate welfare but
      opposes tax credits that assist low-income families seeking
      the best education for their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div

      <title>Dennis Rodman May Be Crazy, But He Is Not Entirely
      Wrong</title>
      <link>
      http://feeds.cato.org/~r/Cato-at-liberty/~3/wO5zKs2aY_U/dennis-rodman-may-be-crazy-he-not-entirely-wrong</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Doug Bandow&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That
      Dennis Rodman is unconventional, even unbalanced, was evident
      when he played professional basketball.&amp;nbsp; His
      athletic skills won him a lucrative contract, but his
      behavior suggested no interest in diplomatic
      protocol.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He has been much
      criticized for visiting the Democratic People’s Republic of
      Korea, a brutal totalitarian dictatorship.&amp;nbsp; There
      are no political freedoms or civil
      liberties.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Open Doors just
      released its latest World Watch List and the DPRK again is
      rated the globe’s worst religious persecutor.&amp;nbsp; The
      government tolerates a little more private economic activity,
      but that free space remains painfully small.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As &lt;a
      href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/doug-bandow/dennis-rodman-may-be-craz_b_4574494.html"&gt;I
      wrote in the &lt;em&gt;Huffington
      Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, cultural and sports
      exchanges should be encouraged.&amp;nbsp; Americans gain a
      small window into the Hermit Kingdom, as well as an equally
      restricted opportunity to share unscripted moments with
      individual North Koreans.&amp;nbsp; When I visited years ago
      I was usually accompanied by a driver, interpreter, and
      handler.&amp;nbsp; But there were moments when I was alone
      with one or another.&amp;nbsp; And such opportunities are
      more frequent with larger groups which involve more local
      officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Private
      engagement of this kind may help influence North Koreans who
      might play a leadership role in the future.&amp;nbsp; The
      family dynasty will not last forever and may implode sooner
      rather than later.&amp;nbsp; It would be better for the U.S.
      if more North Koreans see Americans and realize that they do
      not match the demons of regime propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In fact, the U.S. government also would benefit from
      engagement.&amp;nbsp; Washington should offer to establish
      consular relations, creating a window into the “Hermit
      Kingdom” and a presence that could intercede when Americans
      are arrested, as is becoming more common.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Thus, Rodman’s trips are not objectionable in the
      abstract.&amp;nbsp; Let his team of washed up NBA players
      journey to Pyongyang.&amp;nbsp; And then let the North send
      its team to America.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What Rodman got wrong
      was so shamelessly sucking up to the “young
      general.”&amp;nbsp; Calling Kim his friend for life, singing
      happy birthday to him, and seemingly endorsing the dictator
      and dictatorial system were grotesque.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Rodman need not publicly denounce Kim.&amp;nbsp; But
      he could go about his business, quietly polite to North
      Korean officials and restrained when responding to American
      journalists.&amp;nbsp; He could simply say he went to the
      DPRK for sports, not politics, and then shut up—though,
      admittedly, that would be completely out of character for
      him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The basketball great even glimpsed a
      small truth about l’affaire de Kenneth Bae.&amp;nbsp; The
      Christian missionary obviously is a man of courage and
      conviction.&amp;nbsp; And the government’s relentless
      persecution of religious believers is a human rights
      outrage.&amp;nbsp; There was nothing wrong with “what Kenneth
      Bae did,” as Rodman suggested, that justifies the former’s
      imprisonment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, Bae knew the risks
      he was taking.&amp;nbsp; He chose to visit the North and,
      apparently, violate North Korean law by engaging in
      evangelism.&amp;nbsp; He knew arrest and imprisonment would
      result if he was caught.&amp;nbsp; Unlike the hapless
      85-year-old American tourist who found himself detained and
      accused of war crimes more than six decades ago, Bae
      intentionally though bravely put himself at
      risk.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, Rodman’s response
      when pressed on the issue, “that’s not my job,” was callous,
      not outrageous.&amp;nbsp; Still, basic decency should have
      caused the player to make an effort on the missionary’s
      behalf.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An indirect approach
      likely would have been most effective.&amp;nbsp; Rodman could
      have cited his obvious commitment, despite significant
      criticism at home, to draw the U.S. and North closer
      together, but explained that Bae’s continued imprisonment
      impeded that effort.&amp;nbsp; He then could have advocated
      Bae’s release as a good will gesture.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Rodman is a convenient lightening rod.&amp;nbsp; But
      he isn’t completely wrong.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;North
      Korea is a great human tragedy.&amp;nbsp; And we should hope
      that the next informal ambassador to the DPRK is someone less
      prone to inane outbursts.&amp;nbsp; Nevertheless, Dennis
      Rodman is (a little) better than
      nothing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Justin Logan&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A
      second-term American president begins a diplomatic opening
      with a long-time adversary. Neoconservatives, citing the
      adversary’s interpretation of the agreement, suggest that
      diplomacy harms US interests and tips the balance of power,
      perhaps irreversibly, in favor of the other party. They
      cultivate a sense of growing threat and a weakening America.
      The president responds by suggesting that those opposed to
      diplomacy seem to believe war is inevitable, and that they
      fail to appreciate that diplomacy provides an opportunity to
      avoid such a war, benefiting US interests. His opponents
      counter by accusing him of appeasement and a lack of will,
      calling him a “useful idiot for [enemy]
      propaganda.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s 1988, and &lt;a
      href="http://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/17/magazine/the-right-against-reagan.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;src=pm"&gt;Ronald
      Reagan has just negotiated the INF
      treaty&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The parallel, of course,
      is to the current garment-rending over the interim deal
      negotiated between the permanent 5 members of the UN Security
      Council plus Germany (P5+1) and Iran. There is absolutely no
      plausible interpretation of this deal that puts Iran with or
      closer to a nuclear weapon at the end of the six month period
      covered by the deal. At worst, it either puts 4-6 weeks onto
      the breakout time frame, or else Iran cheats and that
      cheating is detected, given the increased inspection
      schedules in the deal. As the &lt;em&gt;New York
      Times’&lt;/em&gt; account &lt;a
      href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/13/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal.html?ref=world&amp;amp;_r=0"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interim agreement is, in
      effect, an elaborate pause button that provides a basis for
      pursuing a larger accord. It adds at least several weeks to
      the time Iran would need to acquire enough enriched uranium
      for a bomb if it decided to pursue a military option, but it
      can be reversed if either side changes its mind.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Under the interim deal, Iran agreed to stop
      enriching uranium beyond 5 percent, a level that is
      sufficient for energy production but not for a bomb. The
      country’s stockpile of uranium enriched to 20 percent, a step
      toward weapons-grade fuel, will be diluted or converted to
      oxide so that it cannot be readily prepared for military
      purposes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Iran also agreed not to install
      any new centrifuges, start up any that were not already
      operating, or build new enrichment facilities. The agreement
      does not, however, require Iran to stop enriching uranium to
      a low level of 3.5 percent, or to dismantle any existing
      centrifuges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Increasing
      Iran’s more highly enriched stockpile of uranium is a
      necessary condition for their acquisition of a nuclear bomb.
      This deal either will reduce that stockpile, or the deal is
      off. Those are the possible outcomes.*&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Objections to this interim agreement are really hard
      to understand on the merits. Supporters of the current
      Menendez-Kirk bill, which would preemptively hang more
      sanctions over the Iranians’ heads, insist they support
      diplomacy, but given that the Iranians have said repeatedly
      they’ll walk if the bill passes—and given that if they do
      walk, there are going to be a lot more calls for military
      strikes—that’s tough to believe. Only two Senate Republicans
      have yet to sign onto the bill&amp;#8211;Sen. Jeff Flake of
      Arizona and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky&amp;#8211;both of whom
      had supported previous sanctions legislation but are
      exhibiting the conservative values of caution and prudence
      while diplomacy (and diminution of Iran&amp;#8217;s stockpile
      of 20% enriched uranium) ensues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then
      again, it is also hard to understand on the merits the
      neoconservative objections to the INF treaty (and to
      diplomacy with the Soviet Union altogether), and that turned
      out okay. Here’s hoping cooler heads prevail.
      Again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;* Some observers have worried about
      a nuclear facility whose location we don&amp;#8217;t know at
      present. This is indeed a concern, although it is the same
      concern with or without the nuclear deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div
